00:09:16 Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments

Again, livemomentous.com/huberman. now discussion Dr. Nolan
Williams. Thanks joining today. really excited conversation.
long time coming lot questions different compounds,
psychedelics particular. - Yeah. - get discussion, want ask
depression, broadly speaking. Intractable depression. common
depression isn't. heard say wonderful talk gave, depression
perhaps debilitating condition worldwide. yet, contrast
medical conditions like cancer, actually fairly limited number tools
approach depression. yet number tools potency tools growing.
educate us depression, really appreciate it. - Yeah, absolutely.
depression condition that, lot manifestations, know. can
kind depression primarily loss interest. can folks feel
anxious kind overactive. can people don't
anxiety all, underactive low motivation anything.
know, huge range symptoms umbrella
depression. work actually work folks like Conor Liston
Cornell, try actually get biotypes based off neuroimaging see can kind
parse different depression kind presentations, see clinically,
also see brain. Depression disabling condition worldwide.
interesting depression risk factor illnesses, makes
medical psychiatric illnesses worse, right? recently American Heart
Association added depression fourth major risk factor coronary artery disease,
right? alongside risk factors know, hypertension, high blood pressure,
hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol, diabetes, know, high blood sugar, three
list long time depression ended added list
fourth one. know, really interesting, right? addition taking
medications address three risk factors, really thinking
treat folks depression reduce risk heart attack


future? And, know, worked now, don't
complete solution thinking time. thing
interesting heart attack, individuals end heart
attack, risk depression heart attack higher normal
population, right? lot lab actually measuring kind
brain heart connections. can actually, transcranial magnetic stimulation,
form brain stimulation, can actually decelerate heart rate capture
heart rate deceleration mood regulatory regions. actually direct probe
connection. interesting. so, know, said second ago,
know, disabling condition. Moderate depression's disabling
heart attack, acutely heart attack. Severe depression disabling,
cancer without treatment, know, dying cancer without treatment. so,
know, kind underappreciated just disabling depression way.
think important stigma consistently kind reduced years
mental illnesses, idea can start really putting funding putting
focus federal level, know, private foundation level, whatever is,
given university thinking developing treatments. interested
particular clinical set problems around severe high acuity
settings folks depression end in. in, know, emergency
settings go inpatient units. know, rest medicine,
talking heart attacks, start chest pain right now bring
primary care doctor's office, going certain number tests
treatments, right? limited cuz outpatient facility. bring
emergency room that, tests treatments. put
ICU cath lab invasive procedures heart,
tests treatments. psychiatry, elevate acuity individual,
go just depressed depressed now thinking ending
life, number treatments actually go average. mean, scenarios,
go up, average go no tests, right?
focused particular problem. Somebody maybe doing,
know, fairly okay pretty moderate depression depression gets
worse end emergency setting. field really hasn't
developed way consistently able treat problem folks end getting
standard oral antidepressants getting outpatient. came


I, know, dual trained neurologist psychiatrist, went back
forth neurology psychiatry, saw neurology
ways treating acute brain based problems really wanted emulate
psychiatry find ways develop

00:15:11 Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex

engineer new, know, brain based solutions. - lot unpack there. One
thing said is, like focus bit think hear
brain heart connected, described, believe, direct relationship
areas brain associated emotion heart rate. - [Nolan] Yes. -
makes perfect logical sense me. think time, many people
probably think relationship heart mind kind woo
kind soft biology. talking actual physical connection. -
[Nolan] Yep. - Between, area brain it? - first place
stimulation goes called dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. kind sense
control, kind governor brain. know use
magnet, use kind call Faraday's Law, idea using magnetic pulse
induce electrical current electrically conducting substances. case, brain
tissue, not skull scalp that, hair. avoid that, just brain
tissue. direct depolarization cortical neurons, know, surface
brain's neurons, dorsolateral prefrontal. actual
scanner, can do, can see distributes anterior
cingulate insula amygdala. ultimately tract goes something
called nucleus tractus solitarius ultimately vagus nerve heart.
heart consistently seems end organ dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex. measure heart rate standard ways cardiologists measure heart rate
stimulate left dorsolateral, get deceleration heart rate
time locked stimulation. two second train stimulation. one
second, see deceleration, goes 10 beats per minute, it'll
drift back break eight seconds stimulation. Drifts back
stimulation goes back heart rate goes back down. see
heart rate just this, 10 beats per minute every train. know,
visual cortex, don't get that, motor cortex, don't get


findings. really specific kind control region brain. so, yeah,
seems to, know, work, folks' work. Martin Arens Europe,
Netherlands,

00:17:51 Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome

work showing connections. think replicated like four five times. -
mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Anytime hear lateralization
function, get particularly curious obviously two mirror symmetric
sides brain. are, know, rare exceptions this, like pineal things
sort one pineal. special left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex? anything handedness, right hand left
hand? know right-hand left-handedness lot
lateralization function language, topic another time. think
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connected heart way? - Yeah.
Yeah, think, left dorsolateral thought side excite it,
kind excitatory stimulation, potentiating sort stimulation, can reduce
depressive symptoms. guy name Mike Fox Harvard demonstrated
strokes brain cause depression put human
connectome, hundred, know, thousand patient map, ask question
functionally connected to? Left dorsolateral. take lesions
cause mania individuals put human connectome map
ask one common area connected to, right dorsolateral.
seems hemispheric, know, balancing mood two
brain regions. know experimental standpoint too, can
take individuals depression can excite left can inhibit right
antidepressant. can excite right anti-manic
studies. idea hemispheric balancing mood quite
interesting, right? - incredibly interesting. just people know, curious
connectome is, connectome term built notion
genomes large collections sequencing mapping genes.
proteomes proteins, connectomes so-called connectomics, connections
neurons. Human Connectome Project ongoing find
incredible within Connectome Project, can identify regularities right


versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Especially since looked fair number
brains humans, certainly not many have. look
architecture, layers, cell types, even neurochemicals cells
expressing, say, dopamine serotonin receiving input areas make
dopamine serotonin, don't look different right left side. yet
talking kind accelerator brake, will, depression
mania using what, least eye think people's eye look
basically set bits. parts list, less. gives
properties right left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? inputs receive?
something learn development think come
world hemispheric biases? - Yeah, great question. know,
hasn't worked out, original question around, left handed
individual, know, 25% folks end right brain dominance
1% right-handed people right brain dominance flipped, right?
unfortunately study still hasn't done level, 'cause probably
pretty helpful teasing out. But, know, still sorted out, right?
know enough know phenomenon exists can use TMS probe
sorts manipulations. knowledge, hasn't anybody
gotten interested able get mechanism is.
But, know, kind empirically true sense can push pull
systems, case strokes folks have, kind get
brains brain images look strokes landed, kind causal
bits information point

00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation (TMS)

asymmetry. - Interesting. Well, case, going know,
stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate down, transiently,
slows down, seems alleviate least symptoms depression, leads
question case? tell us anything fundamental
depression anxiety inherent depression? think faster heart rate is,
know, part parcel anxiety. laboratory, studied fear bit animals
humans, often observe bradycardia somebody animal


afraid something rather heart rate speeding up, actually slows down,
something people don't think recognize. given stimulation
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate can alleviate depressive
symptoms ways slow heart down, two questions.
think tells us basic architecture depression
physiology level heart? circuit run opposite direction
too? one find ways slow heart rate down, say beta
blocker, help alleviate depression? - Yeah, no, great question.
answer second question first. know ongoing trials this,
stimulate vagus nerve, implanted vagus nerve stimulator, can actually,
know, this, afferent parts vagus project ultimately DLPFC
cingulate anterior insula, same, obviously
tract, right? can stimulate alleviate depression, seems
unusual, right? stimulating cranial nerve neck. can
get brain, actually can improve depressive symptoms. so, know,
evidence kind whole track system. stimulate
part system, appears can improve mood. -
somebody not stimulating electrode vagus nerve dealing
minor depression decided wanted take approach slow
heart rate vagus? instance, exhale emphasized breathing
deliberately slow cadence breathing, things sort. evidence
behavioral interventions kinds can alleviate depression symptoms
depression? evidence indeed feed back dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex achieve alleviation? - Absolutely, yeah.
number studies implicating dorsolateral in, say, know, meditation,
mindfulness, sort thing. small studies, pretty well designed studies
suggesting behavioral interventions mild depression actually work quite well.
seems volitional threshold depression point start
losing, go completely total volition kind semi-volition.
thoughts really hard time controlling sort thing.
go threshold, point gets harder harder
sorts things kind kick work. extreme form catatonia,
right? people severe form depression get kind stuck motorically,
right? obviously can't, no control limited control. so,


know, think threshold sorts interventions will work. Exercise
seems really good treatment mild depression may work
mechanism describing, right? know, know, athletes hold lower
resting heart rate folks aren't, know, athlete, lower
resting heart rate, stopped exercising, couple years later resting heart
rate many cases goes up, right? maybe part process. not
aware studies specifically looking dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post
exercise, great study. think really helpful
understanding this, especially correlation changes kind lowering of,
say, heart rate mood improvements. lot work heart rate
variability depression and, know, studies kind point towards it. Not every
study positive this, quite studies say basically lower heart rate
variability associated with, know, moderate severe depression. may
part mechanism heart brain risk. - intrigued little bit
perplexed relationship heart rate depression. face it,
think depression depressed. lower heart rate might make somebody
depressed. even mentioned catatonia somebody just doesn't seem
motivated excited anything. think mania elevated heart rate
excited. hand, realize anxiety, know, brings ideas
elevated heart rate also built depression. brings back said
earlier, say depression, really talking four five
different? - Yeah, right. - Disorders, lack better word.
percentage people depression approach reducing heart rate
work? Whether not stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex way
transcranial magnetic stimulation taking beta blocker stimulating vagus.
Can throw number, rough number? help, 30%, 50%? long
lasting relief? - Yeah, clear, deceleration heart rate
moment stimulation happening, not something necessarily
maintained chronically. indicator right network
appears itself, know, central mechanism. heart rate variability
piece may be, studies link two, actual deceleration
seems much marker right system. know,
well heart rate system mood system just sit next
stimulation hits both. look much variance mood


explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control
nervous system extent. think autonomic nervous
system, like think seesaw of, know, alertness calmness,
asleep lot calmness, panicking lot
alertness the... that, don't think ever defined, teach
medical students Stanford neuroanatomy, wish someday able
explain hinge process be, right? Not ends seesaw.
know sympathetic nervous system wake us make us panic
make us feel nicely alert calm. know puts someone sleep coma
makes feel relaxed. shifts one side seesaw
tightness hinge seems describing, depression sort
lack control inner state stressed, can't get it.
feeling completely collapsed exhaustion, can't get bed
motivated things help get depression, like workout
social connection eat quality meal, kinds things. perhaps
first time ever heard potential circuit hinge, referring it.
make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules

somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just

TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement

right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not

actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours

dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

00:09:16 Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments

Again, livemomentous.com/huberman. now discussion Dr. Nolan
Williams. Thanks joining today. really excited conversation.
long time coming lot questions different compounds,
psychedelics particular. - Yeah. - get discussion, want ask
depression, broadly speaking. Intractable depression. common
depression isn't. heard say wonderful talk gave, depression
perhaps debilitating condition worldwide. yet, contrast
medical conditions like cancer, actually fairly limited number tools
approach depression. yet number tools potency tools growing.
educate us depression, really appreciate it. - Yeah, absolutely.
depression condition that, lot manifestations, know. can
kind depression primarily loss interest. can folks feel
anxious kind overactive. can people don't
anxiety all, underactive low motivation anything.
know, huge range symptoms umbrella
depression. work actually work folks like Conor Liston
Cornell, try actually get biotypes based off neuroimaging see can kind
parse different depression kind presentations, see clinically,
also see brain. Depression disabling condition worldwide.
interesting depression risk factor illnesses, makes
medical psychiatric illnesses worse, right? recently American Heart
Association added depression fourth major risk factor coronary artery disease,
right? alongside risk factors know, hypertension, high blood pressure,
hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol, diabetes, know, high blood sugar, three
list long time depression ended added list
fourth one. know, really interesting, right? addition taking
medications address three risk factors, really thinking
treat folks depression reduce risk heart attack


future? And, know, worked now, don't
complete solution thinking time. thing
interesting heart attack, individuals end heart
attack, risk depression heart attack higher normal
population, right? lot lab actually measuring kind
brain heart connections. can actually, transcranial magnetic stimulation,
form brain stimulation, can actually decelerate heart rate capture
heart rate deceleration mood regulatory regions. actually direct probe
connection. interesting. so, know, said second ago,
know, disabling condition. Moderate depression's disabling
heart attack, acutely heart attack. Severe depression disabling,
cancer without treatment, know, dying cancer without treatment. so,
know, kind underappreciated just disabling depression way.
think important stigma consistently kind reduced years
mental illnesses, idea can start really putting funding putting
focus federal level, know, private foundation level, whatever is,
given university thinking developing treatments. interested
particular clinical set problems around severe high acuity
settings folks depression end in. in, know, emergency
settings go inpatient units. know, rest medicine,
talking heart attacks, start chest pain right now bring
primary care doctor's office, going certain number tests
treatments, right? limited cuz outpatient facility. bring
emergency room that, tests treatments. put
ICU cath lab invasive procedures heart,
tests treatments. psychiatry, elevate acuity individual,
go just depressed depressed now thinking ending
life, number treatments actually go average. mean, scenarios,
go up, average go no tests, right?
focused particular problem. Somebody maybe doing,
know, fairly okay pretty moderate depression depression gets
worse end emergency setting. field really hasn't
developed way consistently able treat problem folks end getting
standard oral antidepressants getting outpatient. came


I, know, dual trained neurologist psychiatrist, went back
forth neurology psychiatry, saw neurology
ways treating acute brain based problems really wanted emulate
psychiatry find ways develop

00:15:11 Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex

engineer new, know, brain based solutions. - lot unpack there. One
thing said is, like focus bit think hear
brain heart connected, described, believe, direct relationship
areas brain associated emotion heart rate. - [Nolan] Yes. -
makes perfect logical sense me. think time, many people
probably think relationship heart mind kind woo
kind soft biology. talking actual physical connection. -
[Nolan] Yep. - Between, area brain it? - first place
stimulation goes called dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. kind sense
control, kind governor brain. know use
magnet, use kind call Faraday's Law, idea using magnetic pulse
induce electrical current electrically conducting substances. case, brain
tissue, not skull scalp that, hair. avoid that, just brain
tissue. direct depolarization cortical neurons, know, surface
brain's neurons, dorsolateral prefrontal. actual
scanner, can do, can see distributes anterior
cingulate insula amygdala. ultimately tract goes something
called nucleus tractus solitarius ultimately vagus nerve heart.
heart consistently seems end organ dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex. measure heart rate standard ways cardiologists measure heart rate
stimulate left dorsolateral, get deceleration heart rate
time locked stimulation. two second train stimulation. one
second, see deceleration, goes 10 beats per minute, it'll
drift back break eight seconds stimulation. Drifts back
stimulation goes back heart rate goes back down. see
heart rate just this, 10 beats per minute every train. know,
visual cortex, don't get that, motor cortex, don't get


findings. really specific kind control region brain. so, yeah,
seems to, know, work, folks' work. Martin Arens Europe,
Netherlands,

00:17:51 Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome

work showing connections. think replicated like four five times. -
mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Anytime hear lateralization
function, get particularly curious obviously two mirror symmetric
sides brain. are, know, rare exceptions this, like pineal things
sort one pineal. special left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex? anything handedness, right hand left
hand? know right-hand left-handedness lot
lateralization function language, topic another time. think
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connected heart way? - Yeah.
Yeah, think, left dorsolateral thought side excite it,
kind excitatory stimulation, potentiating sort stimulation, can reduce
depressive symptoms. guy name Mike Fox Harvard demonstrated
strokes brain cause depression put human
connectome, hundred, know, thousand patient map, ask question
functionally connected to? Left dorsolateral. take lesions
cause mania individuals put human connectome map
ask one common area connected to, right dorsolateral.
seems hemispheric, know, balancing mood two
brain regions. know experimental standpoint too, can
take individuals depression can excite left can inhibit right
antidepressant. can excite right anti-manic
studies. idea hemispheric balancing mood quite
interesting, right? - incredibly interesting. just people know, curious
connectome is, connectome term built notion
genomes large collections sequencing mapping genes.
proteomes proteins, connectomes so-called connectomics, connections
neurons. Human Connectome Project ongoing find
incredible within Connectome Project, can identify regularities right


versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Especially since looked fair number
brains humans, certainly not many have. look
architecture, layers, cell types, even neurochemicals cells
expressing, say, dopamine serotonin receiving input areas make
dopamine serotonin, don't look different right left side. yet
talking kind accelerator brake, will, depression
mania using what, least eye think people's eye look
basically set bits. parts list, less. gives
properties right left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? inputs receive?
something learn development think come
world hemispheric biases? - Yeah, great question. know,
hasn't worked out, original question around, left handed
individual, know, 25% folks end right brain dominance
1% right-handed people right brain dominance flipped, right?
unfortunately study still hasn't done level, 'cause probably
pretty helpful teasing out. But, know, still sorted out, right?
know enough know phenomenon exists can use TMS probe
sorts manipulations. knowledge, hasn't anybody
gotten interested able get mechanism is.
But, know, kind empirically true sense can push pull
systems, case strokes folks have, kind get
brains brain images look strokes landed, kind causal
bits information point

00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation (TMS)

asymmetry. - Interesting. Well, case, going know,
stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate down, transiently,
slows down, seems alleviate least symptoms depression, leads
question case? tell us anything fundamental
depression anxiety inherent depression? think faster heart rate is,
know, part parcel anxiety. laboratory, studied fear bit animals
humans, often observe bradycardia somebody animal


afraid something rather heart rate speeding up, actually slows down,
something people don't think recognize. given stimulation
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate can alleviate depressive
symptoms ways slow heart down, two questions.
think tells us basic architecture depression
physiology level heart? circuit run opposite direction
too? one find ways slow heart rate down, say beta
blocker, help alleviate depression? - Yeah, no, great question.
answer second question first. know ongoing trials this,
stimulate vagus nerve, implanted vagus nerve stimulator, can actually,
know, this, afferent parts vagus project ultimately DLPFC
cingulate anterior insula, same, obviously
tract, right? can stimulate alleviate depression, seems
unusual, right? stimulating cranial nerve neck. can
get brain, actually can improve depressive symptoms. so, know,
evidence kind whole track system. stimulate
part system, appears can improve mood. -
somebody not stimulating electrode vagus nerve dealing
minor depression decided wanted take approach slow
heart rate vagus? instance, exhale emphasized breathing
deliberately slow cadence breathing, things sort. evidence
behavioral interventions kinds can alleviate depression symptoms
depression? evidence indeed feed back dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex achieve alleviation? - Absolutely, yeah.
number studies implicating dorsolateral in, say, know, meditation,
mindfulness, sort thing. small studies, pretty well designed studies
suggesting behavioral interventions mild depression actually work quite well.
seems volitional threshold depression point start
losing, go completely total volition kind semi-volition.
thoughts really hard time controlling sort thing.
go threshold, point gets harder harder
sorts things kind kick work. extreme form catatonia,
right? people severe form depression get kind stuck motorically,
right? obviously can't, no control limited control. so,


know, think threshold sorts interventions will work. Exercise
seems really good treatment mild depression may work
mechanism describing, right? know, know, athletes hold lower
resting heart rate folks aren't, know, athlete, lower
resting heart rate, stopped exercising, couple years later resting heart
rate many cases goes up, right? maybe part process. not
aware studies specifically looking dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post
exercise, great study. think really helpful
understanding this, especially correlation changes kind lowering of,
say, heart rate mood improvements. lot work heart rate
variability depression and, know, studies kind point towards it. Not every
study positive this, quite studies say basically lower heart rate
variability associated with, know, moderate severe depression. may
part mechanism heart brain risk. - intrigued little bit
perplexed relationship heart rate depression. face it,
think depression depressed. lower heart rate might make somebody
depressed. even mentioned catatonia somebody just doesn't seem
motivated excited anything. think mania elevated heart rate
excited. hand, realize anxiety, know, brings ideas
elevated heart rate also built depression. brings back said
earlier, say depression, really talking four five
different? - Yeah, right. - Disorders, lack better word.
percentage people depression approach reducing heart rate
work? Whether not stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex way
transcranial magnetic stimulation taking beta blocker stimulating vagus.
Can throw number, rough number? help, 30%, 50%? long
lasting relief? - Yeah, clear, deceleration heart rate
moment stimulation happening, not something necessarily
maintained chronically. indicator right network
appears itself, know, central mechanism. heart rate variability
piece may be, studies link two, actual deceleration
seems much marker right system. know,
well heart rate system mood system just sit next
stimulation hits both. look much variance mood


explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control
nervous system extent. think autonomic nervous
system, like think seesaw of, know, alertness calmness,
asleep lot calmness, panicking lot
alertness the... that, don't think ever defined, teach
medical students Stanford neuroanatomy, wish someday able
explain hinge process be, right? Not ends seesaw.
know sympathetic nervous system wake us make us panic
make us feel nicely alert calm. know puts someone sleep coma
makes feel relaxed. shifts one side seesaw
tightness hinge seems describing, depression sort
lack control inner state stressed, can't get it.
feeling completely collapsed exhaustion, can't get bed
motivated things help get depression, like workout
social connection eat quality meal, kinds things. perhaps
first time ever heard potential circuit hinge, referring it.
make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules

somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

Again, livemomentous.com/huberman. now discussion Dr. Nolan
Williams. Thanks joining today. really excited conversation.
long time coming lot questions different compounds,
psychedelics particular. - Yeah. - get discussion, want ask
depression, broadly speaking. Intractable depression. common
depression isn't. heard say wonderful talk gave, depression
perhaps debilitating condition worldwide. yet, contrast
medical conditions like cancer, actually fairly limited number tools
approach depression. yet number tools potency tools growing.
educate us depression, really appreciate it. - Yeah, absolutely.
depression condition that, lot manifestations, know. can
kind depression primarily loss interest. can folks feel
anxious kind overactive. can people don't
anxiety all, underactive low motivation anything.
know, huge range symptoms umbrella
depression. work actually work folks like Conor Liston
Cornell, try actually get biotypes based off neuroimaging see can kind
parse different depression kind presentations, see clinically,
also see brain. Depression disabling condition worldwide.
interesting depression risk factor illnesses, makes
medical psychiatric illnesses worse, right? recently American Heart
Association added depression fourth major risk factor coronary artery disease,
right? alongside risk factors know, hypertension, high blood pressure,
hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol, diabetes, know, high blood sugar, three
list long time depression ended added list
fourth one. know, really interesting, right? addition taking
medications address three risk factors, really thinking
treat folks depression reduce risk heart attack


future? And, know, worked now, don't
complete solution thinking time. thing
interesting heart attack, individuals end heart
attack, risk depression heart attack higher normal
population, right? lot lab actually measuring kind
brain heart connections. can actually, transcranial magnetic stimulation,
form brain stimulation, can actually decelerate heart rate capture
heart rate deceleration mood regulatory regions. actually direct probe
connection. interesting. so, know, said second ago,
know, disabling condition. Moderate depression's disabling
heart attack, acutely heart attack. Severe depression disabling,
cancer without treatment, know, dying cancer without treatment. so,
know, kind underappreciated just disabling depression way.
think important stigma consistently kind reduced years
mental illnesses, idea can start really putting funding putting
focus federal level, know, private foundation level, whatever is,
given university thinking developing treatments. interested
particular clinical set problems around severe high acuity
settings folks depression end in. in, know, emergency
settings go inpatient units. know, rest medicine,
talking heart attacks, start chest pain right now bring
primary care doctor's office, going certain number tests
treatments, right? limited cuz outpatient facility. bring
emergency room that, tests treatments. put
ICU cath lab invasive procedures heart,
tests treatments. psychiatry, elevate acuity individual,
go just depressed depressed now thinking ending
life, number treatments actually go average. mean, scenarios,
go up, average go no tests, right?
focused particular problem. Somebody maybe doing,
know, fairly okay pretty moderate depression depression gets
worse end emergency setting. field really hasn't
developed way consistently able treat problem folks end getting
standard oral antidepressants getting outpatient. came


I, know, dual trained neurologist psychiatrist, went back
forth neurology psychiatry, saw neurology
ways treating acute brain based problems really wanted emulate
psychiatry find ways develop

00:15:11 Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex

engineer new, know, brain based solutions. - lot unpack there. One
thing said is, like focus bit think hear
brain heart connected, described, believe, direct relationship
areas brain associated emotion heart rate. - [Nolan] Yes. -
makes perfect logical sense me. think time, many people
probably think relationship heart mind kind woo
kind soft biology. talking actual physical connection. -
[Nolan] Yep. - Between, area brain it? - first place
stimulation goes called dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. kind sense
control, kind governor brain. know use
magnet, use kind call Faraday's Law, idea using magnetic pulse
induce electrical current electrically conducting substances. case, brain
tissue, not skull scalp that, hair. avoid that, just brain
tissue. direct depolarization cortical neurons, know, surface
brain's neurons, dorsolateral prefrontal. actual
scanner, can do, can see distributes anterior
cingulate insula amygdala. ultimately tract goes something
called nucleus tractus solitarius ultimately vagus nerve heart.
heart consistently seems end organ dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex. measure heart rate standard ways cardiologists measure heart rate
stimulate left dorsolateral, get deceleration heart rate
time locked stimulation. two second train stimulation. one
second, see deceleration, goes 10 beats per minute, it'll
drift back break eight seconds stimulation. Drifts back
stimulation goes back heart rate goes back down. see
heart rate just this, 10 beats per minute every train. know,
visual cortex, don't get that, motor cortex, don't get


findings. really specific kind control region brain. so, yeah,
seems to, know, work, folks' work. Martin Arens Europe,
Netherlands,

00:17:51 Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome

work showing connections. think replicated like four five times. -
mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Anytime hear lateralization
function, get particularly curious obviously two mirror symmetric
sides brain. are, know, rare exceptions this, like pineal things
sort one pineal. special left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex? anything handedness, right hand left
hand? know right-hand left-handedness lot
lateralization function language, topic another time. think
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connected heart way? - Yeah.
Yeah, think, left dorsolateral thought side excite it,
kind excitatory stimulation, potentiating sort stimulation, can reduce
depressive symptoms. guy name Mike Fox Harvard demonstrated
strokes brain cause depression put human
connectome, hundred, know, thousand patient map, ask question
functionally connected to? Left dorsolateral. take lesions
cause mania individuals put human connectome map
ask one common area connected to, right dorsolateral.
seems hemispheric, know, balancing mood two
brain regions. know experimental standpoint too, can
take individuals depression can excite left can inhibit right
antidepressant. can excite right anti-manic
studies. idea hemispheric balancing mood quite
interesting, right? - incredibly interesting. just people know, curious
connectome is, connectome term built notion
genomes large collections sequencing mapping genes.
proteomes proteins, connectomes so-called connectomics, connections
neurons. Human Connectome Project ongoing find
incredible within Connectome Project, can identify regularities right


versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Especially since looked fair number
brains humans, certainly not many have. look
architecture, layers, cell types, even neurochemicals cells
expressing, say, dopamine serotonin receiving input areas make
dopamine serotonin, don't look different right left side. yet
talking kind accelerator brake, will, depression
mania using what, least eye think people's eye look
basically set bits. parts list, less. gives
properties right left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? inputs receive?
something learn development think come
world hemispheric biases? - Yeah, great question. know,
hasn't worked out, original question around, left handed
individual, know, 25% folks end right brain dominance
1% right-handed people right brain dominance flipped, right?
unfortunately study still hasn't done level, 'cause probably
pretty helpful teasing out. But, know, still sorted out, right?
know enough know phenomenon exists can use TMS probe
sorts manipulations. knowledge, hasn't anybody
gotten interested able get mechanism is.
But, know, kind empirically true sense can push pull
systems, case strokes folks have, kind get
brains brain images look strokes landed, kind causal
bits information point

00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation (TMS)

asymmetry. - Interesting. Well, case, going know,
stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate down, transiently,
slows down, seems alleviate least symptoms depression, leads
question case? tell us anything fundamental
depression anxiety inherent depression? think faster heart rate is,
know, part parcel anxiety. laboratory, studied fear bit animals
humans, often observe bradycardia somebody animal


afraid something rather heart rate speeding up, actually slows down,
something people don't think recognize. given stimulation
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate can alleviate depressive
symptoms ways slow heart down, two questions.
think tells us basic architecture depression
physiology level heart? circuit run opposite direction
too? one find ways slow heart rate down, say beta
blocker, help alleviate depression? - Yeah, no, great question.
answer second question first. know ongoing trials this,
stimulate vagus nerve, implanted vagus nerve stimulator, can actually,
know, this, afferent parts vagus project ultimately DLPFC
cingulate anterior insula, same, obviously
tract, right? can stimulate alleviate depression, seems
unusual, right? stimulating cranial nerve neck. can
get brain, actually can improve depressive symptoms. so, know,
evidence kind whole track system. stimulate
part system, appears can improve mood. -
somebody not stimulating electrode vagus nerve dealing
minor depression decided wanted take approach slow
heart rate vagus? instance, exhale emphasized breathing
deliberately slow cadence breathing, things sort. evidence
behavioral interventions kinds can alleviate depression symptoms
depression? evidence indeed feed back dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex achieve alleviation? - Absolutely, yeah.
number studies implicating dorsolateral in, say, know, meditation,
mindfulness, sort thing. small studies, pretty well designed studies
suggesting behavioral interventions mild depression actually work quite well.
seems volitional threshold depression point start
losing, go completely total volition kind semi-volition.
thoughts really hard time controlling sort thing.
go threshold, point gets harder harder
sorts things kind kick work. extreme form catatonia,
right? people severe form depression get kind stuck motorically,
right? obviously can't, no control limited control. so,


know, think threshold sorts interventions will work. Exercise
seems really good treatment mild depression may work
mechanism describing, right? know, know, athletes hold lower
resting heart rate folks aren't, know, athlete, lower
resting heart rate, stopped exercising, couple years later resting heart
rate many cases goes up, right? maybe part process. not
aware studies specifically looking dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post
exercise, great study. think really helpful
understanding this, especially correlation changes kind lowering of,
say, heart rate mood improvements. lot work heart rate
variability depression and, know, studies kind point towards it. Not every
study positive this, quite studies say basically lower heart rate
variability associated with, know, moderate severe depression. may
part mechanism heart brain risk. - intrigued little bit
perplexed relationship heart rate depression. face it,
think depression depressed. lower heart rate might make somebody
depressed. even mentioned catatonia somebody just doesn't seem
motivated excited anything. think mania elevated heart rate
excited. hand, realize anxiety, know, brings ideas
elevated heart rate also built depression. brings back said
earlier, say depression, really talking four five
different? - Yeah, right. - Disorders, lack better word.
percentage people depression approach reducing heart rate
work? Whether not stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex way
transcranial magnetic stimulation taking beta blocker stimulating vagus.
Can throw number, rough number? help, 30%, 50%? long
lasting relief? - Yeah, clear, deceleration heart rate
moment stimulation happening, not something necessarily
maintained chronically. indicator right network
appears itself, know, central mechanism. heart rate variability
piece may be, studies link two, actual deceleration
seems much marker right system. know,
well heart rate system mood system just sit next
stimulation hits both. look much variance mood


explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control
nervous system extent. think autonomic nervous
system, like think seesaw of, know, alertness calmness,
asleep lot calmness, panicking lot
alertness the... that, don't think ever defined, teach
medical students Stanford neuroanatomy, wish someday able
explain hinge process be, right? Not ends seesaw.
know sympathetic nervous system wake us make us panic
make us feel nicely alert calm. know puts someone sleep coma
makes feel relaxed. shifts one side seesaw
tightness hinge seems describing, depression sort
lack control inner state stressed, can't get it.
feeling completely collapsed exhaustion, can't get bed
motivated things help get depression, like workout
social connection eat quality meal, kinds things. perhaps
first time ever heard potential circuit hinge, referring it.
make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules
beliefs beliefs rules, moments longer, switch rules.
somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical

chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad

significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

00:09:16 Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments

Again, livemomentous.com/huberman. now discussion Dr. Nolan
Williams. Thanks joining today. really excited conversation.
long time coming lot questions different compounds,
psychedelics particular. - Yeah. - get discussion, want ask
depression, broadly speaking. Intractable depression. common
depression isn't. heard say wonderful talk gave, depression
perhaps debilitating condition worldwide. yet, contrast
medical conditions like cancer, actually fairly limited number tools
approach depression. yet number tools potency tools growing.
educate us depression, really appreciate it. - Yeah, absolutely.
depression condition that, lot manifestations, know. can
kind depression primarily loss interest. can folks feel
anxious kind overactive. can people don't
anxiety all, underactive low motivation anything.
know, huge range symptoms umbrella
depression. work actually work folks like Conor Liston
Cornell, try actually get biotypes based off neuroimaging see can kind
parse different depression kind presentations, see clinically,
also see brain. Depression disabling condition worldwide.
interesting depression risk factor illnesses, makes
medical psychiatric illnesses worse, right? recently American Heart
Association added depression fourth major risk factor coronary artery disease,
right? alongside risk factors know, hypertension, high blood pressure,
hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol, diabetes, know, high blood sugar, three
list long time depression ended added list
fourth one. know, really interesting, right? addition taking
medications address three risk factors, really thinking
treat folks depression reduce risk heart attack


future? And, know, worked now, don't
complete solution thinking time. thing
interesting heart attack, individuals end heart
attack, risk depression heart attack higher normal
population, right? lot lab actually measuring kind
brain heart connections. can actually, transcranial magnetic stimulation,
form brain stimulation, can actually decelerate heart rate capture
heart rate deceleration mood regulatory regions. actually direct probe
connection. interesting. so, know, said second ago,
know, disabling condition. Moderate depression's disabling
heart attack, acutely heart attack. Severe depression disabling,
cancer without treatment, know, dying cancer without treatment. so,
know, kind underappreciated just disabling depression way.
think important stigma consistently kind reduced years
mental illnesses, idea can start really putting funding putting
focus federal level, know, private foundation level, whatever is,
given university thinking developing treatments. interested
particular clinical set problems around severe high acuity
settings folks depression end in. in, know, emergency
settings go inpatient units. know, rest medicine,
talking heart attacks, start chest pain right now bring
primary care doctor's office, going certain number tests
treatments, right? limited cuz outpatient facility. bring
emergency room that, tests treatments. put
ICU cath lab invasive procedures heart,
tests treatments. psychiatry, elevate acuity individual,
go just depressed depressed now thinking ending
life, number treatments actually go average. mean, scenarios,
go up, average go no tests, right?
focused particular problem. Somebody maybe doing,
know, fairly okay pretty moderate depression depression gets
worse end emergency setting. field really hasn't
developed way consistently able treat problem folks end getting
standard oral antidepressants getting outpatient. came


I, know, dual trained neurologist psychiatrist, went back
forth neurology psychiatry, saw neurology
ways treating acute brain based problems really wanted emulate
psychiatry find ways develop

00:15:11 Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex

engineer new, know, brain based solutions. - lot unpack there. One
thing said is, like focus bit think hear
brain heart connected, described, believe, direct relationship
areas brain associated emotion heart rate. - [Nolan] Yes. -
makes perfect logical sense me. think time, many people
probably think relationship heart mind kind woo
kind soft biology. talking actual physical connection. -
[Nolan] Yep. - Between, area brain it? - first place
stimulation goes called dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. kind sense
control, kind governor brain. know use
magnet, use kind call Faraday's Law, idea using magnetic pulse
induce electrical current electrically conducting substances. case, brain
tissue, not skull scalp that, hair. avoid that, just brain
tissue. direct depolarization cortical neurons, know, surface
brain's neurons, dorsolateral prefrontal. actual
scanner, can do, can see distributes anterior
cingulate insula amygdala. ultimately tract goes something
called nucleus tractus solitarius ultimately vagus nerve heart.
heart consistently seems end organ dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex. measure heart rate standard ways cardiologists measure heart rate
stimulate left dorsolateral, get deceleration heart rate
time locked stimulation. two second train stimulation. one
second, see deceleration, goes 10 beats per minute, it'll
drift back break eight seconds stimulation. Drifts back
stimulation goes back heart rate goes back down. see
heart rate just this, 10 beats per minute every train. know,
visual cortex, don't get that, motor cortex, don't get


findings. really specific kind control region brain. so, yeah,
seems to, know, work, folks' work. Martin Arens Europe,
Netherlands,

00:17:51 Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome

work showing connections. think replicated like four five times. -
mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Anytime hear lateralization
function, get particularly curious obviously two mirror symmetric
sides brain. are, know, rare exceptions this, like pineal things
sort one pineal. special left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex? anything handedness, right hand left
hand? know right-hand left-handedness lot
lateralization function language, topic another time. think
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connected heart way? - Yeah.
Yeah, think, left dorsolateral thought side excite it,
kind excitatory stimulation, potentiating sort stimulation, can reduce
depressive symptoms. guy name Mike Fox Harvard demonstrated
strokes brain cause depression put human
connectome, hundred, know, thousand patient map, ask question
functionally connected to? Left dorsolateral. take lesions
cause mania individuals put human connectome map
ask one common area connected to, right dorsolateral.
seems hemispheric, know, balancing mood two
brain regions. know experimental standpoint too, can
take individuals depression can excite left can inhibit right
antidepressant. can excite right anti-manic
studies. idea hemispheric balancing mood quite
interesting, right? - incredibly interesting. just people know, curious
connectome is, connectome term built notion
genomes large collections sequencing mapping genes.
proteomes proteins, connectomes so-called connectomics, connections
neurons. Human Connectome Project ongoing find
incredible within Connectome Project, can identify regularities right


versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Especially since looked fair number
brains humans, certainly not many have. look
architecture, layers, cell types, even neurochemicals cells
expressing, say, dopamine serotonin receiving input areas make
dopamine serotonin, don't look different right left side. yet
talking kind accelerator brake, will, depression
mania using what, least eye think people's eye look
basically set bits. parts list, less. gives
properties right left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? inputs receive?
something learn development think come
world hemispheric biases? - Yeah, great question. know,
hasn't worked out, original question around, left handed
individual, know, 25% folks end right brain dominance
1% right-handed people right brain dominance flipped, right?
unfortunately study still hasn't done level, 'cause probably
pretty helpful teasing out. But, know, still sorted out, right?
know enough know phenomenon exists can use TMS probe
sorts manipulations. knowledge, hasn't anybody
gotten interested able get mechanism is.
But, know, kind empirically true sense can push pull
systems, case strokes folks have, kind get

bits information point

00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation (TMS)

asymmetry. - Interesting. Well, case, going know,
stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate down, transiently,
slows down, seems alleviate least symptoms depression, leads
question case? tell us anything fundamental
depression anxiety inherent depression? think faster heart rate is,
know, part parcel anxiety. laboratory, studied fear bit animals
humans, often observe bradycardia somebody animal


afraid something rather heart rate speeding up, actually slows down,
something people don't think recognize. given stimulation
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate can alleviate depressive
symptoms ways slow heart down, two questions.
think tells us basic architecture depression
physiology level heart? circuit run opposite direction
too? one find ways slow heart rate down, say beta
blocker, help alleviate depression? - Yeah, no, great question.
answer second question first. know ongoing trials this,
stimulate vagus nerve, implanted vagus nerve stimulator, can actually,
know, this, afferent parts vagus project ultimately DLPFC
cingulate anterior insula, same, obviously
tract, right? can stimulate alleviate depression, seems
unusual, right? stimulating cranial nerve neck. can
get brain, actually can improve depressive symptoms. so, know,
evidence kind whole track system. stimulate
part system, appears can improve mood. -
somebody not stimulating electrode vagus nerve dealing
minor depression decided wanted take approach slow
heart rate vagus? instance, exhale emphasized breathing
deliberately slow cadence breathing, things sort. evidence
behavioral interventions kinds can alleviate depression symptoms
depression? evidence indeed feed back dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex achieve alleviation? - Absolutely, yeah.
number studies implicating dorsolateral in, say, know, meditation,
mindfulness, sort thing. small studies, pretty well designed studies
suggesting behavioral interventions mild depression actually work quite well.
seems volitional threshold depression point start
losing, go completely total volition kind semi-volition.
thoughts really hard time controlling sort thing.
go threshold, point gets harder harder
sorts things kind kick work. extreme form catatonia,
right? people severe form depression get kind stuck motorically,
right? obviously can't, no control limited control. so,


know, think threshold sorts interventions will work. Exercise
seems really good treatment mild depression may work
mechanism describing, right? know, know, athletes hold lower
resting heart rate folks aren't, know, athlete, lower
resting heart rate, stopped exercising, couple years later resting heart
rate many cases goes up, right? maybe part process. not
aware studies specifically looking dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post
exercise, great study. think really helpful
understanding this, especially correlation changes kind lowering of,
say, heart rate mood improvements. lot work heart rate
variability depression and, know, studies kind point towards it. Not every
study positive this, quite studies say basically lower heart rate
variability associated with, know, moderate severe depression. may
part mechanism heart brain risk. - intrigued little bit
perplexed relationship heart rate depression. face it,
think depression depressed. lower heart rate might make somebody
depressed. even mentioned catatonia somebody just doesn't seem
motivated excited anything. think mania elevated heart rate
excited. hand, realize anxiety, know, brings ideas
elevated heart rate also built depression. brings back said
earlier, say depression, really talking four five
different? - Yeah, right. - Disorders, lack better word.
percentage people depression approach reducing heart rate
work? Whether not stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex way
transcranial magnetic stimulation taking beta blocker stimulating vagus.
Can throw number, rough number? help, 30%, 50%? long
lasting relief? - Yeah, clear, deceleration heart rate
moment stimulation happening, not something necessarily
maintained chronically. indicator right network
appears itself, know, central mechanism. heart rate variability
piece may be, studies link two, actual deceleration
seems much marker right system. know,
well heart rate system mood system just sit next
stimulation hits both. look much variance mood


explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control
nervous system extent. think autonomic nervous
system, like think seesaw of, know, alertness calmness,
asleep lot calmness, panicking lot
alertness the... that, don't think ever defined, teach
medical students Stanford neuroanatomy, wish someday able
explain hinge process be, right? Not ends seesaw.
know sympathetic nervous system wake us make us panic
make us feel nicely alert calm. know puts someone sleep coma
makes feel relaxed. shifts one side seesaw
tightness hinge seems describing, depression sort
lack control inner state stressed, can't get it.
feeling completely collapsed exhaustion, can't get bed
motivated things help get depression, like workout
social connection eat quality meal, kinds things. perhaps
first time ever heard potential circuit hinge, referring it.
make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules
beliefs beliefs rules, moments longer, switch rules.
somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving

restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity

depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent

balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian

Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

future? And, know, worked now, don't
complete solution thinking time. thing
interesting heart attack, individuals end heart
attack, risk depression heart attack higher normal
population, right? lot lab actually measuring kind
brain heart connections. can actually, transcranial magnetic stimulation,
form brain stimulation, can actually decelerate heart rate capture
heart rate deceleration mood regulatory regions. actually direct probe
connection. interesting. so, know, said second ago,
know, disabling condition. Moderate depression's disabling
heart attack, acutely heart attack. Severe depression disabling,
cancer without treatment, know, dying cancer without treatment. so,
know, kind underappreciated just disabling depression way.
think important stigma consistently kind reduced years
mental illnesses, idea can start really putting funding putting
focus federal level, know, private foundation level, whatever is,
given university thinking developing treatments. interested
particular clinical set problems around severe high acuity
settings folks depression end in. in, know, emergency
settings go inpatient units. know, rest medicine,
talking heart attacks, start chest pain right now bring
primary care doctor's office, going certain number tests
treatments, right? limited cuz outpatient facility. bring
emergency room that, tests treatments. put
ICU cath lab invasive procedures heart,
tests treatments. psychiatry, elevate acuity individual,
go just depressed depressed now thinking ending
life, number treatments actually go average. mean, scenarios,
go up, average go no tests, right?
focused particular problem. Somebody maybe doing,
know, fairly okay pretty moderate depression depression gets
worse end emergency setting. field really hasn't
developed way consistently able treat problem folks end getting
standard oral antidepressants getting outpatient. came


I, know, dual trained neurologist psychiatrist, went back
forth neurology psychiatry, saw neurology
ways treating acute brain based problems really wanted emulate
psychiatry find ways develop

00:15:11 Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex

engineer new, know, brain based solutions. - lot unpack there. One
thing said is, like focus bit think hear
brain heart connected, described, believe, direct relationship
areas brain associated emotion heart rate. - [Nolan] Yes. -
makes perfect logical sense me. think time, many people
probably think relationship heart mind kind woo
kind soft biology. talking actual physical connection. -
[Nolan] Yep. - Between, area brain it? - first place
stimulation goes called dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. kind sense
control, kind governor brain. know use
magnet, use kind call Faraday's Law, idea using magnetic pulse
induce electrical current electrically conducting substances. case, brain
tissue, not skull scalp that, hair. avoid that, just brain
tissue. direct depolarization cortical neurons, know, surface
brain's neurons, dorsolateral prefrontal. actual
scanner, can do, can see distributes anterior
cingulate insula amygdala. ultimately tract goes something
called nucleus tractus solitarius ultimately vagus nerve heart.
heart consistently seems end organ dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex. measure heart rate standard ways cardiologists measure heart rate
stimulate left dorsolateral, get deceleration heart rate
time locked stimulation. two second train stimulation. one
second, see deceleration, goes 10 beats per minute, it'll
drift back break eight seconds stimulation. Drifts back
stimulation goes back heart rate goes back down. see
heart rate just this, 10 beats per minute every train. know,
visual cortex, don't get that, motor cortex, don't get


findings. really specific kind control region brain. so, yeah,
seems to, know, work, folks' work. Martin Arens Europe,
Netherlands,

00:17:51 Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome

work showing connections. think replicated like four five times. -
mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Anytime hear lateralization
function, get particularly curious obviously two mirror symmetric
sides brain. are, know, rare exceptions this, like pineal things
sort one pineal. special left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex? anything handedness, right hand left
hand? know right-hand left-handedness lot
lateralization function language, topic another time. think
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connected heart way? - Yeah.
Yeah, think, left dorsolateral thought side excite it,
kind excitatory stimulation, potentiating sort stimulation, can reduce
depressive symptoms. guy name Mike Fox Harvard demonstrated
strokes brain cause depression put human
connectome, hundred, know, thousand patient map, ask question
functionally connected to? Left dorsolateral. take lesions
cause mania individuals put human connectome map
ask one common area connected to, right dorsolateral.
seems hemispheric, know, balancing mood two
brain regions. know experimental standpoint too, can
take individuals depression can excite left can inhibit right
antidepressant. can excite right anti-manic
studies. idea hemispheric balancing mood quite
interesting, right? - incredibly interesting. just people know, curious
connectome is, connectome term built notion
genomes large collections sequencing mapping genes.
proteomes proteins, connectomes so-called connectomics, connections
neurons. Human Connectome Project ongoing find
incredible within Connectome Project, can identify regularities right


versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Especially since looked fair number
brains humans, certainly not many have. look
architecture, layers, cell types, even neurochemicals cells
expressing, say, dopamine serotonin receiving input areas make
dopamine serotonin, don't look different right left side. yet
talking kind accelerator brake, will, depression
mania using what, least eye think people's eye look
basically set bits. parts list, less. gives
properties right left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? inputs receive?
something learn development think come
world hemispheric biases? - Yeah, great question. know,
hasn't worked out, original question around, left handed
individual, know, 25% folks end right brain dominance
1% right-handed people right brain dominance flipped, right?
unfortunately study still hasn't done level, 'cause probably
pretty helpful teasing out. But, know, still sorted out, right?
know enough know phenomenon exists can use TMS probe
sorts manipulations. knowledge, hasn't anybody
gotten interested able get mechanism is.
But, know, kind empirically true sense can push pull
systems, case strokes folks have, kind get
brains brain images look strokes landed, kind causal
bits information point

00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation (TMS)

asymmetry. - Interesting. Well, case, going know,
stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate down, transiently,
slows down, seems alleviate least symptoms depression, leads
question case? tell us anything fundamental
depression anxiety inherent depression? think faster heart rate is,
know, part parcel anxiety. laboratory, studied fear bit animals
humans, often observe bradycardia somebody animal


afraid something rather heart rate speeding up, actually slows down,
something people don't think recognize. given stimulation
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate can alleviate depressive
symptoms ways slow heart down, two questions.
think tells us basic architecture depression
physiology level heart? circuit run opposite direction
too? one find ways slow heart rate down, say beta
blocker, help alleviate depression? - Yeah, no, great question.
answer second question first. know ongoing trials this,
stimulate vagus nerve, implanted vagus nerve stimulator, can actually,
know, this, afferent parts vagus project ultimately DLPFC
cingulate anterior insula, same, obviously
tract, right? can stimulate alleviate depression, seems
unusual, right? stimulating cranial nerve neck. can
get brain, actually can improve depressive symptoms. so, know,
evidence kind whole track system. stimulate
part system, appears can improve mood. -
somebody not stimulating electrode vagus nerve dealing
minor depression decided wanted take approach slow
heart rate vagus? instance, exhale emphasized breathing
deliberately slow cadence breathing, things sort. evidence
behavioral interventions kinds can alleviate depression symptoms
depression? evidence indeed feed back dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex achieve alleviation? - Absolutely, yeah.
number studies implicating dorsolateral in, say, know, meditation,
mindfulness, sort thing. small studies, pretty well designed studies
suggesting behavioral interventions mild depression actually work quite well.
seems volitional threshold depression point start
losing, go completely total volition kind semi-volition.
thoughts really hard time controlling sort thing.
go threshold, point gets harder harder
sorts things kind kick work. extreme form catatonia,
right? people severe form depression get kind stuck motorically,
right? obviously can't, no control limited control. so,


know, think threshold sorts interventions will work. Exercise
seems really good treatment mild depression may work
mechanism describing, right? know, know, athletes hold lower
resting heart rate folks aren't, know, athlete, lower
resting heart rate, stopped exercising, couple years later resting heart
rate many cases goes up, right? maybe part process. not
aware studies specifically looking dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post
exercise, great study. think really helpful
understanding this, especially correlation changes kind lowering of,
say, heart rate mood improvements. lot work heart rate
variability depression and, know, studies kind point towards it. Not every
study positive this, quite studies say basically lower heart rate
variability associated with, know, moderate severe depression. may
part mechanism heart brain risk. - intrigued little bit
perplexed relationship heart rate depression. face it,
think depression depressed. lower heart rate might make somebody
depressed. even mentioned catatonia somebody just doesn't seem
motivated excited anything. think mania elevated heart rate
excited. hand, realize anxiety, know, brings ideas
elevated heart rate also built depression. brings back said
earlier, say depression, really talking four five
different? - Yeah, right. - Disorders, lack better word.
percentage people depression approach reducing heart rate
work? Whether not stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex way
transcranial magnetic stimulation taking beta blocker stimulating vagus.
Can throw number, rough number? help, 30%, 50%? long
lasting relief? - Yeah, clear, deceleration heart rate
moment stimulation happening, not something necessarily
maintained chronically. indicator right network
appears itself, know, central mechanism. heart rate variability
piece may be, studies link two, actual deceleration
seems much marker right system. know,
well heart rate system mood system just sit next
stimulation hits both. look much variance mood


explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control
nervous system extent. think autonomic nervous
system, like think seesaw of, know, alertness calmness,
asleep lot calmness, panicking lot
alertness the... that, don't think ever defined, teach
medical students Stanford neuroanatomy, wish someday able
explain hinge process be, right? Not ends seesaw.
know sympathetic nervous system wake us make us panic
make us feel nicely alert calm. know puts someone sleep coma
makes feel relaxed. shifts one side seesaw
tightness hinge seems describing, depression sort
lack control inner state stressed, can't get it.
feeling completely collapsed exhaustion, can't get bed
motivated things help get depression, like workout
social connection eat quality meal, kinds things. perhaps
first time ever heard potential circuit hinge, referring it.
make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules

somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving

restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-

cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-

say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy

catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring

know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours

throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain

substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

I, know, dual trained neurologist psychiatrist, went back
forth neurology psychiatry, saw neurology
ways treating acute brain based problems really wanted emulate
psychiatry find ways develop

00:15:11 Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex

engineer new, know, brain based solutions. - lot unpack there. One
thing said is, like focus bit think hear
brain heart connected, described, believe, direct relationship
areas brain associated emotion heart rate. - [Nolan] Yes. -
makes perfect logical sense me. think time, many people
probably think relationship heart mind kind woo
kind soft biology. talking actual physical connection. -
[Nolan] Yep. - Between, area brain it? - first place
stimulation goes called dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. kind sense
control, kind governor brain. know use
magnet, use kind call Faraday's Law, idea using magnetic pulse
induce electrical current electrically conducting substances. case, brain
tissue, not skull scalp that, hair. avoid that, just brain
tissue. direct depolarization cortical neurons, know, surface
brain's neurons, dorsolateral prefrontal. actual
scanner, can do, can see distributes anterior
cingulate insula amygdala. ultimately tract goes something
called nucleus tractus solitarius ultimately vagus nerve heart.
heart consistently seems end organ dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex. measure heart rate standard ways cardiologists measure heart rate
stimulate left dorsolateral, get deceleration heart rate
time locked stimulation. two second train stimulation. one
second, see deceleration, goes 10 beats per minute, it'll
drift back break eight seconds stimulation. Drifts back
stimulation goes back heart rate goes back down. see
heart rate just this, 10 beats per minute every train. know,
visual cortex, don't get that, motor cortex, don't get


findings. really specific kind control region brain. so, yeah,
seems to, know, work, folks' work. Martin Arens Europe,
Netherlands,

00:17:51 Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome

work showing connections. think replicated like four five times. -
mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Anytime hear lateralization
function, get particularly curious obviously two mirror symmetric
sides brain. are, know, rare exceptions this, like pineal things
sort one pineal. special left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex? anything handedness, right hand left
hand? know right-hand left-handedness lot
lateralization function language, topic another time. think
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connected heart way? - Yeah.
Yeah, think, left dorsolateral thought side excite it,
kind excitatory stimulation, potentiating sort stimulation, can reduce
depressive symptoms. guy name Mike Fox Harvard demonstrated
strokes brain cause depression put human
connectome, hundred, know, thousand patient map, ask question
functionally connected to? Left dorsolateral. take lesions
cause mania individuals put human connectome map
ask one common area connected to, right dorsolateral.
seems hemispheric, know, balancing mood two
brain regions. know experimental standpoint too, can
take individuals depression can excite left can inhibit right
antidepressant. can excite right anti-manic
studies. idea hemispheric balancing mood quite
interesting, right? - incredibly interesting. just people know, curious
connectome is, connectome term built notion
genomes large collections sequencing mapping genes.
proteomes proteins, connectomes so-called connectomics, connections
neurons. Human Connectome Project ongoing find
incredible within Connectome Project, can identify regularities right


versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Especially since looked fair number
brains humans, certainly not many have. look
architecture, layers, cell types, even neurochemicals cells
expressing, say, dopamine serotonin receiving input areas make
dopamine serotonin, don't look different right left side. yet
talking kind accelerator brake, will, depression
mania using what, least eye think people's eye look
basically set bits. parts list, less. gives
properties right left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? inputs receive?
something learn development think come
world hemispheric biases? - Yeah, great question. know,
hasn't worked out, original question around, left handed
individual, know, 25% folks end right brain dominance
1% right-handed people right brain dominance flipped, right?
unfortunately study still hasn't done level, 'cause probably
pretty helpful teasing out. But, know, still sorted out, right?
know enough know phenomenon exists can use TMS probe
sorts manipulations. knowledge, hasn't anybody
gotten interested able get mechanism is.
But, know, kind empirically true sense can push pull
systems, case strokes folks have, kind get
brains brain images look strokes landed, kind causal
bits information point

00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation (TMS)

asymmetry. - Interesting. Well, case, going know,
stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate down, transiently,
slows down, seems alleviate least symptoms depression, leads
question case? tell us anything fundamental
depression anxiety inherent depression? think faster heart rate is,
know, part parcel anxiety. laboratory, studied fear bit animals
humans, often observe bradycardia somebody animal


afraid something rather heart rate speeding up, actually slows down,
something people don't think recognize. given stimulation
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate can alleviate depressive
symptoms ways slow heart down, two questions.
think tells us basic architecture depression
physiology level heart? circuit run opposite direction
too? one find ways slow heart rate down, say beta
blocker, help alleviate depression? - Yeah, no, great question.
answer second question first. know ongoing trials this,
stimulate vagus nerve, implanted vagus nerve stimulator, can actually,
know, this, afferent parts vagus project ultimately DLPFC
cingulate anterior insula, same, obviously
tract, right? can stimulate alleviate depression, seems
unusual, right? stimulating cranial nerve neck. can
get brain, actually can improve depressive symptoms. so, know,
evidence kind whole track system. stimulate
part system, appears can improve mood. -
somebody not stimulating electrode vagus nerve dealing
minor depression decided wanted take approach slow
heart rate vagus? instance, exhale emphasized breathing
deliberately slow cadence breathing, things sort. evidence
behavioral interventions kinds can alleviate depression symptoms
depression? evidence indeed feed back dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex achieve alleviation? - Absolutely, yeah.
number studies implicating dorsolateral in, say, know, meditation,
mindfulness, sort thing. small studies, pretty well designed studies
suggesting behavioral interventions mild depression actually work quite well.
seems volitional threshold depression point start
losing, go completely total volition kind semi-volition.
thoughts really hard time controlling sort thing.
go threshold, point gets harder harder
sorts things kind kick work. extreme form catatonia,
right? people severe form depression get kind stuck motorically,
right? obviously can't, no control limited control. so,


know, think threshold sorts interventions will work. Exercise
seems really good treatment mild depression may work
mechanism describing, right? know, know, athletes hold lower
resting heart rate folks aren't, know, athlete, lower
resting heart rate, stopped exercising, couple years later resting heart
rate many cases goes up, right? maybe part process. not
aware studies specifically looking dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post
exercise, great study. think really helpful
understanding this, especially correlation changes kind lowering of,
say, heart rate mood improvements. lot work heart rate
variability depression and, know, studies kind point towards it. Not every
study positive this, quite studies say basically lower heart rate
variability associated with, know, moderate severe depression. may
part mechanism heart brain risk. - intrigued little bit
perplexed relationship heart rate depression. face it,
think depression depressed. lower heart rate might make somebody
depressed. even mentioned catatonia somebody just doesn't seem
motivated excited anything. think mania elevated heart rate
excited. hand, realize anxiety, know, brings ideas
elevated heart rate also built depression. brings back said
earlier, say depression, really talking four five
different? - Yeah, right. - Disorders, lack better word.
percentage people depression approach reducing heart rate
work? Whether not stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex way
transcranial magnetic stimulation taking beta blocker stimulating vagus.
Can throw number, rough number? help, 30%, 50%? long
lasting relief? - Yeah, clear, deceleration heart rate
moment stimulation happening, not something necessarily
maintained chronically. indicator right network
appears itself, know, central mechanism. heart rate variability
piece may be, studies link two, actual deceleration
seems much marker right system. know,
well heart rate system mood system just sit next
stimulation hits both. look much variance mood


explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control
nervous system extent. think autonomic nervous
system, like think seesaw of, know, alertness calmness,
asleep lot calmness, panicking lot
alertness the... that, don't think ever defined, teach
medical students Stanford neuroanatomy, wish someday able
explain hinge process be, right? Not ends seesaw.
know sympathetic nervous system wake us make us panic
make us feel nicely alert calm. know puts someone sleep coma
makes feel relaxed. shifts one side seesaw
tightness hinge seems describing, depression sort
lack control inner state stressed, can't get it.
feeling completely collapsed exhaustion, can't get bed
motivated things help get depression, like workout
social connection eat quality meal, kinds things. perhaps
first time ever heard potential circuit hinge, referring it.
make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word

transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard

remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like

somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,

given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just


mention people want regulate sleep, sleep toolkit

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

findings. really specific kind control region brain. so, yeah,
seems to, know, work, folks' work. Martin Arens Europe,
Netherlands,

00:17:51 Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome

work showing connections. think replicated like four five times. -
mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Anytime hear lateralization
function, get particularly curious obviously two mirror symmetric
sides brain. are, know, rare exceptions this, like pineal things
sort one pineal. special left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex? anything handedness, right hand left
hand? know right-hand left-handedness lot
lateralization function language, topic another time. think
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connected heart way? - Yeah.
Yeah, think, left dorsolateral thought side excite it,
kind excitatory stimulation, potentiating sort stimulation, can reduce
depressive symptoms. guy name Mike Fox Harvard demonstrated
strokes brain cause depression put human
connectome, hundred, know, thousand patient map, ask question
functionally connected to? Left dorsolateral. take lesions
cause mania individuals put human connectome map
ask one common area connected to, right dorsolateral.
seems hemispheric, know, balancing mood two
brain regions. know experimental standpoint too, can
take individuals depression can excite left can inhibit right
antidepressant. can excite right anti-manic
studies. idea hemispheric balancing mood quite
interesting, right? - incredibly interesting. just people know, curious
connectome is, connectome term built notion
genomes large collections sequencing mapping genes.
proteomes proteins, connectomes so-called connectomics, connections
neurons. Human Connectome Project ongoing find
incredible within Connectome Project, can identify regularities right


versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Especially since looked fair number
brains humans, certainly not many have. look
architecture, layers, cell types, even neurochemicals cells
expressing, say, dopamine serotonin receiving input areas make
dopamine serotonin, don't look different right left side. yet
talking kind accelerator brake, will, depression
mania using what, least eye think people's eye look
basically set bits. parts list, less. gives
properties right left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? inputs receive?
something learn development think come
world hemispheric biases? - Yeah, great question. know,
hasn't worked out, original question around, left handed
individual, know, 25% folks end right brain dominance
1% right-handed people right brain dominance flipped, right?
unfortunately study still hasn't done level, 'cause probably
pretty helpful teasing out. But, know, still sorted out, right?
know enough know phenomenon exists can use TMS probe
sorts manipulations. knowledge, hasn't anybody
gotten interested able get mechanism is.
But, know, kind empirically true sense can push pull
systems, case strokes folks have, kind get
brains brain images look strokes landed, kind causal
bits information point

00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation (TMS)

asymmetry. - Interesting. Well, case, going know,
stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate down, transiently,
slows down, seems alleviate least symptoms depression, leads
question case? tell us anything fundamental
depression anxiety inherent depression? think faster heart rate is,
know, part parcel anxiety. laboratory, studied fear bit animals
humans, often observe bradycardia somebody animal


afraid something rather heart rate speeding up, actually slows down,
something people don't think recognize. given stimulation
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate can alleviate depressive
symptoms ways slow heart down, two questions.
think tells us basic architecture depression
physiology level heart? circuit run opposite direction
too? one find ways slow heart rate down, say beta
blocker, help alleviate depression? - Yeah, no, great question.
answer second question first. know ongoing trials this,
stimulate vagus nerve, implanted vagus nerve stimulator, can actually,
know, this, afferent parts vagus project ultimately DLPFC
cingulate anterior insula, same, obviously
tract, right? can stimulate alleviate depression, seems
unusual, right? stimulating cranial nerve neck. can
get brain, actually can improve depressive symptoms. so, know,
evidence kind whole track system. stimulate
part system, appears can improve mood. -
somebody not stimulating electrode vagus nerve dealing
minor depression decided wanted take approach slow
heart rate vagus? instance, exhale emphasized breathing
deliberately slow cadence breathing, things sort. evidence
behavioral interventions kinds can alleviate depression symptoms
depression? evidence indeed feed back dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex achieve alleviation? - Absolutely, yeah.
number studies implicating dorsolateral in, say, know, meditation,
mindfulness, sort thing. small studies, pretty well designed studies
suggesting behavioral interventions mild depression actually work quite well.
seems volitional threshold depression point start
losing, go completely total volition kind semi-volition.
thoughts really hard time controlling sort thing.
go threshold, point gets harder harder
sorts things kind kick work. extreme form catatonia,
right? people severe form depression get kind stuck motorically,
right? obviously can't, no control limited control. so,


know, think threshold sorts interventions will work. Exercise
seems really good treatment mild depression may work
mechanism describing, right? know, know, athletes hold lower
resting heart rate folks aren't, know, athlete, lower
resting heart rate, stopped exercising, couple years later resting heart
rate many cases goes up, right? maybe part process. not
aware studies specifically looking dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post
exercise, great study. think really helpful
understanding this, especially correlation changes kind lowering of,
say, heart rate mood improvements. lot work heart rate
variability depression and, know, studies kind point towards it. Not every
study positive this, quite studies say basically lower heart rate
variability associated with, know, moderate severe depression. may
part mechanism heart brain risk. - intrigued little bit
perplexed relationship heart rate depression. face it,
think depression depressed. lower heart rate might make somebody
depressed. even mentioned catatonia somebody just doesn't seem
motivated excited anything. think mania elevated heart rate
excited. hand, realize anxiety, know, brings ideas
elevated heart rate also built depression. brings back said
earlier, say depression, really talking four five
different? - Yeah, right. - Disorders, lack better word.
percentage people depression approach reducing heart rate
work? Whether not stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex way
transcranial magnetic stimulation taking beta blocker stimulating vagus.
Can throw number, rough number? help, 30%, 50%? long
lasting relief? - Yeah, clear, deceleration heart rate
moment stimulation happening, not something necessarily
maintained chronically. indicator right network
appears itself, know, central mechanism. heart rate variability
piece may be, studies link two, actual deceleration
seems much marker right system. know,
well heart rate system mood system just sit next
stimulation hits both. look much variance mood


explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control
nervous system extent. think autonomic nervous
system, like think seesaw of, know, alertness calmness,
asleep lot calmness, panicking lot
alertness the... that, don't think ever defined, teach
medical students Stanford neuroanatomy, wish someday able
explain hinge process be, right? Not ends seesaw.
know sympathetic nervous system wake us make us panic
make us feel nicely alert calm. know puts someone sleep coma
makes feel relaxed. shifts one side seesaw
tightness hinge seems describing, depression sort
lack control inner state stressed, can't get it.
feeling completely collapsed exhaustion, can't get bed
motivated things help get depression, like workout
social connection eat quality meal, kinds things. perhaps
first time ever heard potential circuit hinge, referring it.
make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

00:37:46 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

00:39:00 Belief/Identity “Rules”, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3K2. Based
told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules
beliefs beliefs rules, moments longer, switch rules.
somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Especially since looked fair number
brains humans, certainly not many have. look
architecture, layers, cell types, even neurochemicals cells
expressing, say, dopamine serotonin receiving input areas make
dopamine serotonin, don't look different right left side. yet
talking kind accelerator brake, will, depression
mania using what, least eye think people's eye look
basically set bits. parts list, less. gives
properties right left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? inputs receive?
something learn development think come
world hemispheric biases? - Yeah, great question. know,
hasn't worked out, original question around, left handed
individual, know, 25% folks end right brain dominance
1% right-handed people right brain dominance flipped, right?
unfortunately study still hasn't done level, 'cause probably
pretty helpful teasing out. But, know, still sorted out, right?
know enough know phenomenon exists can use TMS probe
sorts manipulations. knowledge, hasn't anybody
gotten interested able get mechanism is.
But, know, kind empirically true sense can push pull
systems, case strokes folks have, kind get
brains brain images look strokes landed, kind causal
bits information point

00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation (TMS)

asymmetry. - Interesting. Well, case, going know,
stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate down, transiently,
slows down, seems alleviate least symptoms depression, leads
question case? tell us anything fundamental
depression anxiety inherent depression? think faster heart rate is,
know, part parcel anxiety. laboratory, studied fear bit animals
humans, often observe bradycardia somebody animal


afraid something rather heart rate speeding up, actually slows down,
something people don't think recognize. given stimulation
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate can alleviate depressive
symptoms ways slow heart down, two questions.
think tells us basic architecture depression
physiology level heart? circuit run opposite direction
too? one find ways slow heart rate down, say beta
blocker, help alleviate depression? - Yeah, no, great question.
answer second question first. know ongoing trials this,
stimulate vagus nerve, implanted vagus nerve stimulator, can actually,
know, this, afferent parts vagus project ultimately DLPFC
cingulate anterior insula, same, obviously
tract, right? can stimulate alleviate depression, seems
unusual, right? stimulating cranial nerve neck. can
get brain, actually can improve depressive symptoms. so, know,
evidence kind whole track system. stimulate
part system, appears can improve mood. -
somebody not stimulating electrode vagus nerve dealing
minor depression decided wanted take approach slow
heart rate vagus? instance, exhale emphasized breathing
deliberately slow cadence breathing, things sort. evidence
behavioral interventions kinds can alleviate depression symptoms
depression? evidence indeed feed back dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex achieve alleviation? - Absolutely, yeah.
number studies implicating dorsolateral in, say, know, meditation,
mindfulness, sort thing. small studies, pretty well designed studies
suggesting behavioral interventions mild depression actually work quite well.
seems volitional threshold depression point start
losing, go completely total volition kind semi-volition.
thoughts really hard time controlling sort thing.
go threshold, point gets harder harder
sorts things kind kick work. extreme form catatonia,
right? people severe form depression get kind stuck motorically,
right? obviously can't, no control limited control. so,


know, think threshold sorts interventions will work. Exercise
seems really good treatment mild depression may work
mechanism describing, right? know, know, athletes hold lower
resting heart rate folks aren't, know, athlete, lower
resting heart rate, stopped exercising, couple years later resting heart
rate many cases goes up, right? maybe part process. not
aware studies specifically looking dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post
exercise, great study. think really helpful
understanding this, especially correlation changes kind lowering of,
say, heart rate mood improvements. lot work heart rate
variability depression and, know, studies kind point towards it. Not every
study positive this, quite studies say basically lower heart rate
variability associated with, know, moderate severe depression. may
part mechanism heart brain risk. - intrigued little bit
perplexed relationship heart rate depression. face it,
think depression depressed. lower heart rate might make somebody
depressed. even mentioned catatonia somebody just doesn't seem
motivated excited anything. think mania elevated heart rate
excited. hand, realize anxiety, know, brings ideas
elevated heart rate also built depression. brings back said
earlier, say depression, really talking four five
different? - Yeah, right. - Disorders, lack better word.
percentage people depression approach reducing heart rate
work? Whether not stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex way
transcranial magnetic stimulation taking beta blocker stimulating vagus.
Can throw number, rough number? help, 30%, 50%? long
lasting relief? - Yeah, clear, deceleration heart rate
moment stimulation happening, not something necessarily
maintained chronically. indicator right network
appears itself, know, central mechanism. heart rate variability
piece may be, studies link two, actual deceleration
seems much marker right system. know,
well heart rate system mood system just sit next
stimulation hits both. look much variance mood


explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control

make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules

somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving

restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-

cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-

say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy

catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment

trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?

place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity

balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian

Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

afraid something rather heart rate speeding up, actually slows down,
something people don't think recognize. given stimulation
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows heart rate can alleviate depressive
symptoms ways slow heart down, two questions.
think tells us basic architecture depression
physiology level heart? circuit run opposite direction
too? one find ways slow heart rate down, say beta
blocker, help alleviate depression? - Yeah, no, great question.
answer second question first. know ongoing trials this,
stimulate vagus nerve, implanted vagus nerve stimulator, can actually,
know, this, afferent parts vagus project ultimately DLPFC
cingulate anterior insula, same, obviously
tract, right? can stimulate alleviate depression, seems
unusual, right? stimulating cranial nerve neck. can
get brain, actually can improve depressive symptoms. so, know,
evidence kind whole track system. stimulate
part system, appears can improve mood. -
somebody not stimulating electrode vagus nerve dealing
minor depression decided wanted take approach slow
heart rate vagus? instance, exhale emphasized breathing
deliberately slow cadence breathing, things sort. evidence
behavioral interventions kinds can alleviate depression symptoms
depression? evidence indeed feed back dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex achieve alleviation? - Absolutely, yeah.
number studies implicating dorsolateral in, say, know, meditation,
mindfulness, sort thing. small studies, pretty well designed studies
suggesting behavioral interventions mild depression actually work quite well.
seems volitional threshold depression point start
losing, go completely total volition kind semi-volition.
thoughts really hard time controlling sort thing.
go threshold, point gets harder harder
sorts things kind kick work. extreme form catatonia,
right? people severe form depression get kind stuck motorically,
right? obviously can't, no control limited control. so,


know, think threshold sorts interventions will work. Exercise
seems really good treatment mild depression may work
mechanism describing, right? know, know, athletes hold lower
resting heart rate folks aren't, know, athlete, lower
resting heart rate, stopped exercising, couple years later resting heart
rate many cases goes up, right? maybe part process. not
aware studies specifically looking dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post
exercise, great study. think really helpful
understanding this, especially correlation changes kind lowering of,
say, heart rate mood improvements. lot work heart rate
variability depression and, know, studies kind point towards it. Not every
study positive this, quite studies say basically lower heart rate
variability associated with, know, moderate severe depression. may
part mechanism heart brain risk. - intrigued little bit
perplexed relationship heart rate depression. face it,
think depression depressed. lower heart rate might make somebody
depressed. even mentioned catatonia somebody just doesn't seem
motivated excited anything. think mania elevated heart rate
excited. hand, realize anxiety, know, brings ideas
elevated heart rate also built depression. brings back said
earlier, say depression, really talking four five
different? - Yeah, right. - Disorders, lack better word.
percentage people depression approach reducing heart rate
work? Whether not stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex way
transcranial magnetic stimulation taking beta blocker stimulating vagus.
Can throw number, rough number? help, 30%, 50%? long
lasting relief? - Yeah, clear, deceleration heart rate
moment stimulation happening, not something necessarily
maintained chronically. indicator right network
appears itself, know, central mechanism. heart rate variability
piece may be, studies link two, actual deceleration
seems much marker right system. know,
well heart rate system mood system just sit next
stimulation hits both. look much variance mood


explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control
nervous system extent. think autonomic nervous
system, like think seesaw of, know, alertness calmness,
asleep lot calmness, panicking lot
alertness the... that, don't think ever defined, teach
medical students Stanford neuroanatomy, wish someday able
explain hinge process be, right? Not ends seesaw.
know sympathetic nervous system wake us make us panic
make us feel nicely alert calm. know puts someone sleep coma
makes feel relaxed. shifts one side seesaw
tightness hinge seems describing, depression sort
lack control inner state stressed, can't get it.
feeling completely collapsed exhaustion, can't get bed
motivated things help get depression, like workout
social connection eat quality meal, kinds things. perhaps
first time ever heard potential circuit hinge, referring it.
make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

00:37:46 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules
beliefs beliefs rules, moments longer, switch rules.
somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

know, think threshold sorts interventions will work. Exercise
seems really good treatment mild depression may work
mechanism describing, right? know, know, athletes hold lower
resting heart rate folks aren't, know, athlete, lower
resting heart rate, stopped exercising, couple years later resting heart
rate many cases goes up, right? maybe part process. not
aware studies specifically looking dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post
exercise, great study. think really helpful
understanding this, especially correlation changes kind lowering of,
say, heart rate mood improvements. lot work heart rate
variability depression and, know, studies kind point towards it. Not every
study positive this, quite studies say basically lower heart rate
variability associated with, know, moderate severe depression. may
part mechanism heart brain risk. - intrigued little bit
perplexed relationship heart rate depression. face it,
think depression depressed. lower heart rate might make somebody
depressed. even mentioned catatonia somebody just doesn't seem
motivated excited anything. think mania elevated heart rate
excited. hand, realize anxiety, know, brings ideas
elevated heart rate also built depression. brings back said
earlier, say depression, really talking four five
different? - Yeah, right. - Disorders, lack better word.
percentage people depression approach reducing heart rate
work? Whether not stimulation left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex way
transcranial magnetic stimulation taking beta blocker stimulating vagus.
Can throw number, rough number? help, 30%, 50%? long
lasting relief? - Yeah, clear, deceleration heart rate
moment stimulation happening, not something necessarily
maintained chronically. indicator right network
appears itself, know, central mechanism. heart rate variability
piece may be, studies link two, actual deceleration
seems much marker right system. know,
well heart rate system mood system just sit next
stimulation hits both. look much variance mood


explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control
nervous system extent. think autonomic nervous
system, like think seesaw of, know, alertness calmness,
asleep lot calmness, panicking lot
alertness the... that, don't think ever defined, teach
medical students Stanford neuroanatomy, wish someday able
explain hinge process be, right? Not ends seesaw.
know sympathetic nervous system wake us make us panic
make us feel nicely alert calm. know puts someone sleep coma
makes feel relaxed. shifts one side seesaw
tightness hinge seems describing, depression sort
lack control inner state stressed, can't get it.
feeling completely collapsed exhaustion, can't get bed
motivated things help get depression, like workout
social connection eat quality meal, kinds things. perhaps
first time ever heard potential circuit hinge, referring it.
make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

00:37:46 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

part anterior cingulate processes emotion. - like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now
called AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational
nutritional needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens,


reason still take Athletic Greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health. gut important. populated gut
microbiota communicate brain, immune system, basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health.
probiotics Athletic Greens optimal vital microbiotic health.
addition, Athletic Greens contains number adaptogens, vitamins, minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great.

00:39:00 Belief/Identity “Rules”, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3K2. Based
told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules
beliefs beliefs rules, moments longer, switch rules.
somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity

effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see

depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent

balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours

dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

explained heart rate deceleration, not huge amount, right?
explains small percentage. unlikely simply reducing heart rate.
fact, know, many years, propranolol sorts drugs actually
implicating causing depression. kind debunked, unlikely
simply decelerating heart rate's going improve depression.
tell area mood regulatory area,
parasympathetic cortical kind process going gets causes
happen. it's, know, independent mood. can take normal healthy
individual can going decelerate heart rate. -
glad mentioned parasympathetic nervous system, course the,
people think rest digest kind calming side autonomic
nervous system. hearing say this, particular just told
me, not lower heart rate protects depression
higher heart rate associated depression, although extremes might
true, rather something regulatory network, ability control
nervous system extent. think autonomic nervous
system, like think seesaw of, know, alertness calmness,
asleep lot calmness, panicking lot
alertness the... that, don't think ever defined, teach
medical students Stanford neuroanatomy, wish someday able
explain hinge process be, right? Not ends seesaw.
know sympathetic nervous system wake us make us panic
make us feel nicely alert calm. know puts someone sleep coma
makes feel relaxed. shifts one side seesaw
tightness hinge seems describing, depression sort
lack control inner state stressed, can't get it.
feeling completely collapsed exhaustion, can't get bed
motivated things help get depression, like workout
social connection eat quality meal, kinds things. perhaps
first time ever heard potential circuit hinge, referring it.
make sense all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, just
want make sure framing correctly mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
studies, identical stimulation right dorsolateral,
can get acceleration. know, just kind confirming idea


lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

00:37:46 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules
beliefs beliefs rules, moments longer, switch rules.
somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary

antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement

right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect

effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

lateralization, right? appears even prefrontal cortex, know, cortical
areas seem lateralized way. And, know, less, right finding
variable depending upon study. left's consistent way. So... -
talked transcranial magnetic stimulation getting networks
also just want take brief tangent say, 'cause heard say before,
think vital saying, really not stimulation areas
specific brain area vagus nerve important per se. really network,
connection, series connections. think really important people
understand

00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS

kind new emerging theme really. thing seems extremely
important us consider lateral prefrontal cortices doing?
involved, instance, sensation, sensing heart rate? involved thinking
planning? gets simple question know lot people
have, is, can talk depression? mild. Can talk
manic state excited state, positively excited state doesn't
qualify mania? know, areas brain, think responsible
perception motor control. mysterious frontal cortex area,
people say executive function, planning, et cetera. talking thoughts?
talking structured thoughts talking dreamlike thoughts?
world going prefrontal cortex? spend career
neuroscience still can't really understand maybe 50
things. - Yeah, no, great question. So, know, to... one studies
working addition depression work actually trying change
trait hypnotizability. David Spiegel working know,
found published 10 years ago different part left dorsolateral
functionally connected dorsal anterior cingulate lot functional
connectivity high hypnotizables not much low hypnotizables. kind
different sub-region within bigger brain region call left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex part seems important regulating mood. left
dorsolateral seems connections location specific within overall kind
named brain region connect various parts cingulate seem


regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name
color see word written different way. basically stimulate
way inhibits left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either one, can actually
knock ability well it'll take longer people incongruent
cards able name it. kind time delay greater
got stimulated. part prefrontal cortex
different part prefrontal cortex involved mood regulation. nice
thing TMS can go can find areas
functionally defined brain imaging can perturb answer
question talking about. understand part prefrontal cortex
function, part? able stimulate inhibitory way within
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved sort cognitive control area.
able knock area increase trait hypnotizability, people
greater hypnotizability got active stimulation versus got sham.
suggests brain circuit involved process therapeutic
hypnosis ends being. different region within left dorsolateral than,
say, intensive stimulation approaches treat severe
depression able get people depression. know, part
dorsolateral seems lower the, know, kind lateral inferior
DLPFC connected subgenual anterior cingulate,

00:37:46 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

part anterior cingulate processes emotion. - like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now
called AG1, vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational
nutritional needs. taking Athletic Greens since 2012, delighted
sponsoring podcast. reason started taking Athletic Greens,


reason still take Athletic Greens usually twice day gets

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3K2. Based
told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules
beliefs beliefs rules, moments longer, switch rules.
somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment

trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?

effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity

people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

regulate it. Right? knock left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
people Stroop task, instance, task have,
simple task, probably know this. people name color words.
look one cards show you, it'll word red red
easy called congruent. incongruent red color blue
name, say word, don't name color. -
suppress response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. so, sorry, name

told us Stroop task role prefrontal cortex Stroop task,
Stroop task rule switching game. saying one moment, rule
read whatever word says switch say, rule now
tell color word written suppress whatever word
says, okay? - [Nolan] right. - Okay, rule sense is, like that,
transiently adopted belief system. imagine depression,
sorts backstory it, course psychiatrist psychologist friend can pull
thread. Like instance, somebody might believe bad
don't deserve love. trying bring typical language talk
about. will never succeed. even keep succeeding, just
going get harder harder will never feel good. sort rules like
Stroop task. level. rules pervasive time,
unfortunately. imagine PFC also contains sort maps
algorithms related rules emotionality self representation things
heard, think must data saying that, know, whatever heard
middle school someone made fun us, can remember that. 'Cause can
remember things people said jacket wore one day something
fourth grade, crazy, didn't even like jacket. Now think kind cool,
anyway. point intense memory things set


sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules
beliefs beliefs rules, moments longer, switch rules.
somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end

day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical

chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind

something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming

days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set

kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need

think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just


mention people want regulate sleep, sleep toolkit

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

sort rule question. Like maybe don't really know dress, instance.
Maybe always wear black shirt. seriousness, seems like
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amazing position access rules
beliefs beliefs rules, moments longer, switch rules.
somebody depressed just simply look mirror say,
"You great, fantastic," feels like lie feel like garbage say that.
doesn't fit rule. like saying card not red, card green,
eyes tell red. seems like something prefrontal cortex
principle gives flexibility rules based know Stroop task.
given connectivity, can assume talk therapy occurs psychiatrist
office friend journaling something, know
reporting things trauma difficult circumstances rules contain
tend hide inside us feel miserable anything really,
rescripting that, somehow allows us sort Stroop task
beliefs. tremendous leap? just really trying frame context
people think depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. -
network components vitally important, guess trying figure like
algorithms govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. kind
standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, therapist trying
identify beliefs know, kind determine fixed are, know,
flexible saying, help folks find another explanation
kind reintegrate potential explanation memory system,
right? think TMS really interesting, actually, lot patients who've
told me, like therapist told wasn't trying hard enough therapy,
know, really trying hard, are, know, moderate, pretty severe
depressed patients. soon get well TMS approaches,
know, kind rapid five day approach next week come see
say, "You know weekend looked therapy books now
can understand it." so, know, actually see TMS way kind
exogenous sorts cognitive functions milder forms depression can pull off
psychotherapy. know, idea able kind turn prefrontal
cortex govern deeper regions. depression, deeper regions
govern prefrontal cortex. precede prefrontal cortex timing-wise.
got data review now seeing depressed individuals


responsive rapid TMS approach, call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy, SNT, SAINT, look brain people get
this, will temporal delay cingulate front DLPFC.
people normal healthy controls, no depression, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
temporally front anterior cingulate. effective treatment, can flip
timing things dorsolateral front anterior cingulate, just like
normal person. - not talking obviously physically moving
structures, talking time, activation. one case, like coach
telling player do. like player telling coach do.
restore order game. - restore order game. looks
like depression, point, bunch kind spontaneous content semi-
volitional kind generated conflict detection system.
cingulate seems sense conflict kind feed information, gets overactive
depression. depression, looks like left dorsolateral not sufficiently
clamp it. therapy appears kind restore that. see
TMS region just exogenously sort thing.
restore governance left dorsolateral cingulate area,
correlated treatment improvement. degree can re-time, re-
regulate time left dorsolateral

00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment

cingulate, antidepressant effect have. - Can therefore
say crude terms dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really governor
interpret physiological signals spontaneous thoughts? - places lens rest
brain sees things through. can experiments can put
normal healthy control person scanner can make feel like
loss control can see region come offline, right? can
experimentally manipulate system, kind buffing up, like TMS almost
like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting

right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?

aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity

depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent

balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian

Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

like exercise brain, right? kind exercising region
physiologically relevant signal kind turning system on.
interesting, think really interesting show to, know, couple
folks, know, probably five six folks actually told this,
remit early enough week, dense stimulation approach


can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian

Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

can stimulate people really rapidly five day block. don't discriminate
get better stop. get better day one, still give
four days protocol that. can't, getting
point can tell long going take, not yet. so,
know, every time somebody gets better day one two, beginning first
started this, say, know, not sure, know, think safe
keep going, know, want do? everybody like, no, want
keep going. so, know, Wednesday, like totally zeroed
depression scales, know, even better people walking around. Like really
no anxiety, no depression anything. Thursday, first guy told this,
came said, "You know, driving back hotel decided go
beach just sat totally present present moment
hour." like, "I read mindfulness books, experienced last
night never experienced anything like before." like, hmm,
interesting, kind wasn't sure. didn't tell obviously patients
that, five last couple years, remit early
week, end week like going beach like totally
people describe pretty mindful present moment sort experience,
really interesting, know, is. mean, don't full scientific
data tell you, just interesting anecdote, right? folks, push
point feeling kind clinically well people end reporting
additional set

00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia

features. - mentioned cingulate anterior cingulate particular.
now feel like first time career, sense
prefrontal cortex might actually besides providing bumper rest
brain. cingulate, seems, primitive structure sense ideally
regulation top control prefrontal cortex, mapped
cingulate? non neuroscientist there, say mapped,
put someone scanner focus cingulate put electrode there,
makes neurons fire? sorts things body mind
world light up, lack better phrase, cingulate?


cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot

no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware

kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit

some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud

out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical

serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain

kind challenges idea. think powerful

case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering

think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity

effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see

depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent

balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain

substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, Stroop task, incongruent word color
associations, dorsal part that. obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain
kind triggers. see neural imaging studies will point anterior
cingulate. kind crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, anterior
cingulotomy way treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause
area seems overactive people experiencing obsessive compulsive
disorder. can kind walk, cingulate wraps around, know, white matter
track like bundles, wraps around that. part that, around
that, that, depending upon much conflict task
emotional component, ventral subgenual activation is. dorsal
part anterior cingulate seems kind pure cognitive, maybe
obsessive compulsive disorder sort area. Whereas start getting mood
sorts triggers, like facial expression conflicts supposed to, know,
emotional Stroop task show word happy
face person looks mad, another way sort
Stroop conflict. seems perigenual, subgenual areas, right? can
kind of, can trigger cingulate based off level emotional valence none
lot. seems distributed. are, know, heart rate
kind components autonomic components too. something
called akinetic mutism, know, board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral
neurologist, seen, know, lot call zebra cases
neurology people have, know, unusual neurological presentations
one akinetic mutism. glioma sitting inner hemispheric
fissure kind pressure cingulate, people can get almost
catatonic looking state kind get stuck don't speak.
tells something cingulate works well, right? like not
functioning, people hard time kind connecting reality. seems
need constantly online able interact exterior world. - involved
dissociative states sometimes people stressed
depressed experience? said catatonia extreme one, know someone
instance, get really stressed, can even someone yells
even someone's angry perceive someone's angry them,
developmental backstory likely feel way, sort just kind
can't... high functioning individual normally, just sort can't


function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa

able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may

of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds

certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid

know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove

pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

function. can't complete simple things like email groceries things short
while. almost like catatonia refer dissociative state. see
depression? mean, speculating whether not
involves cingulate, saying holds lot salience thinking
example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, see catatonia extreme outcome
depression sometimes schizophrenia illnesses. Dissociation
extreme outcome, even cases, less extreme outcome PTSD trauma.
know, also phenomenon happens naturally people
highly hypnotizable. ask David Spiegel, say that, know,
work working around posterior cingulate capacity
disassociate. yeah, know, stimulation approach DLPFC, dorsal
anterior cingulate, one subscales moved dissociative
subscale hypnotizability. even normal individual, know, see
change kind experience dissociation. - highly hypnotizable. David's
hypnotized number times. fact, clip Huberman Live
clips channel. always, well, always. Starting early teens, started exploring
hypnosis. extremely hypnotizable. self hypnosis assisted hypnosis. don't
know ever go dissociative states. try avoid forcing running
clinical session right now,

00:54:27 Ketamine, Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience
Biology?

assess anything like that. brings something really interesting,
think, aware popular emerging treatments
depression include things like ketamine, dissociative anesthetic. right?
- Yep. - assumption dissociative anesthetic, leads
dissociative states people can sort third person feel somewhat
distanced emotions. also hearing emerging
treatments, psilocybin one them, treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
parse detail, lead exact opposite state
effect drug, highly engaged emotionality heart rate sense
self. can also lead relief depression. Now, whether not this, again, reflects
depression many conditions opposed just one, whether not somehow


tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

tickling cases pushing really hard opposite ends scale really
matter, absolutely fascinated, again, also perplexed this.
drug induces dissociative states drug taken separately induces
hyper-associative states lead relief condition? - Yeah, no,
great question. Yeah, ketamine, know, level dissociation appears
correlated therapeutic effect. appears necessary not sufficient
produce antidepressant effect. folks don't psychological change
ketamine don't experience dissociation typically tend less potent
antidepressant effects ketamine. study couple years ago, really
interesting. gave folks naltrexone, opiate antagonist, mu kappa
opiate receptor antagonist. gave folk, individuals, pill pill
placebo, no idea one getting. - low dose
naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah,
gave typical ketamine therapeutic dose, gave 50 milligrams naltrexone
placebo. individuals, gave two infusions, one
conditions. antidepressant effect, waited relapsed
gave 'em condition. looked see effect
blocking opioid receptor, effect see antidepressant effect
blocking opioid receptor idea ketamine works way lot
researchers time thought it, know, completely worked in,
glutamate system, no effect naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just
interacts opioid system. doesn't anything systems. Ketamine
lot effects over, know, clear opioid effects mice various ways
looking that, MDA receptor antagonism glutamate effects.
just glutamate part part driving antidepressant effect, shouldn't
difference antidepressant effect two conditions. If, however,
antidepressant effect primarily opioid properties ketamine necessary
antidepressant effect, loss antidepressant effect
ketamine plus naltrexone condition observed ketamine plus placebo
condition. saw dramatic blockade
antidepressant effect naltrexone present. Yeah, people
antidepressant effect ketamine plus placebo alone. friends mine
TMS study pain stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
gave IV naloxone, works basically way naltrexone,


able block anti-pain effects TMS opiate blocker. idea
another kind convergent point, right? idea opioid receptor may
role mood regulation. also interesting look people getting
total knee operation, painful operation, right? know, total knee replacement
age, sex, know, everything match individuals going that.
group people don't depression group people
depression. presence depression triples oral opioid dose day four,
right? - required. - required cover pain may happening
not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least
transiently, seems antidepressant effect. Chronically, seems
pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect
dissociation. dissociation time. psychological
effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

not just treating physical pain, may treating emotional pain well, right? least

pro-depressant effect. can make people treatment resistant. But, know,
interesting phenomenon. yeah, opioid system seems pretty involved.
interesting ketamine trial didn't see effect

effect call trip kind dissociative effect people
psychological phenomenon ketamine, identical times. kind
of, also challenged idea psychological experience psychedelic effect
may necessary produce effect pharmacology doesn't
matter long can achieve state. so, know, think pretty
clearly debunked idea underlying pharmacology state, know,
seem important. don't know sure can, lot people working
this, can take out, know, essentially psychological effect still
drug works treat illness trying target. mouse
study week LSD analog able see
animal level data suggest true. figure humans,
kind determined. curious, right? able kind use experimental
manipulations try separate, know, phenomenon apart really
understand what. - critical critical conversation
surely get to, progression psychedelics illicit illegal drugs
clinically validated, presumably point, either decriminalized legal drugs,
not yet happened, least not US. just make sure people
getting crucial is. really talking fact that,
know, somebody takes multi gram dose psilocybin somebody takes MDMA
take ketamine experience relief trauma, depression,


addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

addiction, number things indeed compounds
shown useful certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. like
gravitational pull idea that, oh, hallucinations. dissociative
state. feeling connectedness. really saying
certainly true, may case major source positive shift
occurs effect drug underlying biology, like shifts mu opioid
receptor, la experiments naltrexone, change underlying
neuromodulation anywhere nothing something real shift.
know group UC Davis published paper nature year
ago also looking chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics remove
hallucinogenic properties, mood altering properties, actually seeing
pretty impressive effects shifts mood drug wears off. know gets
people upset hear it. gets lot people upset really. people
think, oh no, intense experience matters. fact, may not
case all. fact, powerful people sometimes liken mind to,
know, like birth new child incredible experience
people feel much connection. sort connect experience
actual birth connection, fact they're, true turns out,
bunch things happening too. simply reflection fact
holding child pheromonal effects et cetera.

01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance Circuit?

anyway, think important different variables figured out. Along
lines, want make sure dive bit deeper ketamine
psilocybin, touch really important topic press lot
lately, SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause can't really
discussion depression without talking SSRIs. want circle
back ketamine psilocybin. seems now data essentially state
no direct link serotonin levels depression. Although
understanding SSRIs powerfully effective certain forms obsessive
compulsive disorder may also effective treatment depression, may
effect unrelated serotonin itself. right?
think SSRIs? useful, not useful? going SSRIs


patients people well? - Yeah, experiment described
bit ago around naltrexone ketamine first time aware
able essentially eliminate antidepressant's effect using second drug
kind blockade. highlights bigger issue, right? issue haven't
good way really understanding drugs work. difference.
think lot controversy difficult, think, folks see
something can one hand work hand, don't know
works, right? SSRIs clearly work. know, many, many meta analyses kind
proving out, right? subpopulation individuals, achieve great benefit
depression, know, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic, know, things, can see
improvement symptoms call SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. issue selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end
blocking reuptake serotonin leaving serotonin, know, kind
between, two neurons allowing serotonin kind
there. issue don't work immediately, right? don't work like
day start taking them. suggests probably not exactly
serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes

kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

serotonin directly driving it, much likely may
some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? know things like brain derived
neurotrophic factor get upregulated chronic oral antidepressant use.
kind idea things work, powerful, think
authors paper, extremely controversial paper, part trying say
not deficit serotonin. not born people call chemical
imbalance. psychiatry's known this. not actually new information, anybody,
know, kind rehashing bunch information known
now, lay press, kind hit way didn't seem grab attention
previous publications. idea chemical imbalance idea
wrong. really think part's important think that, know, while,
think psychiatry, know, call psychiatry 1.0, right? kind idea Freud
psychotherapy origins. lot around, know, family
experiences psychotherapy kind going correcting helping figure
out, know, able see, people hear can eventually
come conclusion certain cognitions aren't helping you, right?
huge importance there, history where, know, things like


schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

schizophrenogenic mother that, know, concept point,
right? transitioned to, know, long time chemical
imbalance, call psychiatry 2.0. know, idea something
chemically missing think trouble patient not physician,
not someone steeped sorts ideas, who's, know, kind
person, kind average American there, right, sending message
something missing me, whether experiences no control
child chemical brain. think really powerful TMS,
know, really powerful TMS, even powerful psychedelic story
saying something different. know, TMS works no serotonin coming
brain, right? rapid form TMS works one five
days. no, unlikely long term kind upregulation
serotonin driving that. work actually kind pushes back serotonin
hypothesis kind center depression says, look, not
giving anybody serotonin. simply turning brain regions
focused circuitry. psychiatry 3.0. not just like neuromodulation.
Neuromodulations really nice, know, use case psychiatry 3.0 'cause
way focally directly perturb brain regions whatever modality using.
know, lot groups actually neuroimaging
after, able see circuit level changes something like psilocybin
ketamine long drug gone, right? Suggesting brain regions
converge, subgenual default mode network connection see changing
Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. set brain regions
ketamine psilocybin seem act on, act connections brain
networks seem shift. refocuses story something highly
correctable. basically electrophysiology basically kind recalibrating
circuit recalibrate-able instead something missing set
experiences early life going forever trap psychiatric diagnoses.
kind challenges idea. think powerful
psychiatry 3.0. idea focusing circuit gets us thinking
psychiatry psychiatric illnesses something recoverable. People can get
better. People, know, seen TMS techniques, seen
psychedelic work done people actually normal levels
mood sustained periods time or- - Within five days. - Within five less days.


case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see

depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent

balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian

Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

case psychedelics, within days, right? can get people
states. totally well, no drug system point, case
psychedelics. never drug system, case TMS. just
tells us fixable. just like heart. just like arrhythmia heart.
just like, know, illnesses, like broken leg. can go
something can get somebody better. think empowering
lot patients told say, know, people will relapse need
stimulation need psychedelics whatever is, tell me,
relapsed depressed again, never think killing
know go get stimulated again, improves, gets better. will able
reachieve can't. don't fear chronically broken. don't fear
chemical imbalance still imbalanced. don't fear things couldn't control
childhood, know, going drive problem forever.
think powerful this. - [Andrew] sense control. - sense
control, sense of... not stimulation themselves. not
administering drug trials themselves. probably never will.
will probably medical treatments. choosing it. sense,
control. - Yeah, good friend, won't reasons that'll
become clear moment, quite obese lost lot weight really
proud himself. guess say sort relapsed sense. Not
way, far along. tone around different. knew
accomplished goal before. disappointed himself, knew
exactly relapsed. clear. essentially relapsed
previous set eating behaviors lack exercise behaviors now brought
back again. just resonates story that, know, somebody
understands can

01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution

before, idea considering new rules,
there's... brings question psychedelics frankly altered
thinking perception occurs high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. seems
disordered thinking, even though random, right? Hearing colors
seeing sounds always kind cliche statement Timothy Leary area. Also,


know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch

kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian

Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

know, right there, Stroop task sorts. synesthesia, combining
perceptions, sort Stroop task-ish new set rules
stuff, right? many people report improvements trauma related symptomology
depression, understand read clinical trials, taking
psilocybin. sessions, something comes mind spontaneously.
talking earlier, will report, instance, new way seeing
old problem. old problem voice no good, nothing
will ever work out, even subtle that. raises two questions.
One basic functioning human brain, think
brain ever hold rules don't serve us well? one question.
second question is, psilocybin related molecules terms
neurochemistry, terms ways disrupt thinking feeling, et cetera,
session allow novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. first
question, think evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? think
individual person level, know, doesn't make whole lot sense
really stressed out, us want eat more, right? individual person level
'cause like, not particularly good health long term.
think it, like, know, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, highly
stressed out, likely not food point
eat bunch food high fat, high sugar, high carb food put weight
next phase stress may battle don't food
enough fuel board, right? end result probably lot biology
not useful modern era. think brain for, say, say PTSD,
right? lot veterans come back experience PTSD symptoms
not useful back home, right? know, hear loud noise
sudden behind car behind a, know, heard folks,
know, jump run behind trashcan whatever middle San Francisco
hear loud noise. put back battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly
adaptive. - highly adaptive, right? think interesting we,
absence using substances like psychedelics, end persistent
memories attached negatively balanced emotion, predominantly,
saying earlier, jacket elementary school, know, various things like
too, right? remember things. hold onto things
think evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, seems to, whatever reason,


kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40

outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

kind alleviate substances, new like MDMA,
around thousands years, like psilocybin, used sacrament traditions,
seem therapeutic effect. seems pretty long lasting
phenomenon. just curious, right? curious absence that,
things will keep going on, presence exposure,
sudden see resolution problem. work now treating
folks with, Navy SEALs, data's still analyzed. anecdotes
getting, right, folks coming back saying finally gone, right?
set PTSD symptoms finally gone. idea whatever reason, going
probably highly plastic state like talking earlier, upregulation
brain derived neurotrophic factor case ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic
factor, highly plastic state ability kind re-experience memories.
know, always reconsolidate memory bring back up,
always reconsolidate it. reconsolidating state, whatever reason, may
drive therapeutic effect. And, know, jury's still out. say kind
agnostic tool using kind guy. Like business find treatments
help people. much like pragmatic it, know. sort thing,
lot cultural baggage, sort thing ultimately ends
therapeutic, can design trials convince others is,
absolutely use it. know? doesn't, clearly shouldn't use it, right?
think big question field's going work out. hard time
blinding trials placebo condition not easy pull off, obviously. -
placebo psilocybin journey hard imagine. - got, know,
thinking maybe ketamine study talking earlier,
give people naltrexone ketamine, maybe good sort placebo
condition, right? 'Cause know can block actual antidepressant
effects ketamine, still experience, know. one way
it. thinking ways really kind proving out.
been, yeah, think kind central way thinking this.
yeah, think work done far, first psilocybin trial,

01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin &
Depression Treatment



first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain

substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

first MDMA trial published "Nature Medicine" recently. -
generally say? mean, effective number people one session,
two sessions? sort general contour of? start psilocybin
MDMA. - Yeah, MDMA appears to, one MDMA sessions, anti
PTSD effect seems be, know, outside kind standard assumed levels
PTSD improvement can observe individuals level PTSD, right?
call effect size, essentially like effect size, measure
allows compare different treatments different conditions
are, know, agnostic actual illness is. know, effect size there,
know, approach effect size things pretty effective like antacids
heartburn, right? see MDMA treatment. - mean
people trauma, again, talking clinical setting, take
one two doses MDMA. think standard maps dose 150 175 milligrams.
Again, physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep,
exactly. - twice. broadly speaking, percentage people
trauma report feeling significant relief trauma afterward? -
2/3 people clinically significant change PTSD. - impressive. -
[Nolan] impressive, right? - long lasting that? mean, trials
ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, appears last while. earlier trials
followed people out, seemed last kind years range
people. it's, know, pretty compelling. Psilocybin, know, contrast
ketamine, average lasts week half single
infusion, much shorter. - get repeated infusions ketamine
every 10 days so? Forever? - people, end getting like bunch
doses couple weeks. people seems last while.
know, think psilocybin story depression MDMA story
PTSD seemed interesting me. - psilocybin, rough percentages
on, relief not trauma, depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah,
exactly. it's, know, open label studies, closer like half 2/3 people
end getting better depending upon level treatment resistance. blinded
trials like 1/3 people, know, experienced relief. is,
know, press release data, know, hasn't, knowledge,
hasn't published yet. looking forward seeing full paper
one. it, know, separated placebo looks pretty good well. looks like


it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity

mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects

including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind

Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert

significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details

health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just


mention people want regulate sleep, sleep toolkit

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic

want start off saying please come back teach us

Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...

different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

it's, know, first two trials need done get thing approved

01:24:12 MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin

treatment resistant depression. stuff looks good. - terms MDMA,
many years reported popular press paper published
science MDMA neurotoxic, kill serotonin neurons.
always said. saw another paper published science wasn't retraction
previous paper, rather second paper group essentially
admitted first time around, injected monkeys not MDMA,
methamphetamine, known neurotoxic. kind public
admittance oops like really big screw up, oops, never retraction
never really publicly acknowledged correction popular press. seems
appropriate dosage range, one two sessions, assumption,
assumption, tell right wrong here, MDMA not
neurotoxic serotonergic neurons appropriate doses appropriate sourcing,
et cetera. - interesting study that, think guy's name Halpern, last
name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. think Joshua
Halpern, blanking first name, but... - Casey Halpern guest
podcast former colleague Stanford, unfortunately lost
University Pennsylvania maybe someday bring back. - Yeah, right.
individual, know, received NIH funding actually, NIDA, know,
National Institute Drug Abuse funding explore individuals Mormon faith
Utah partake MDMA. way works MDMA happened kind
lot religious documents developed. MDMA isn't
prohibited drug list. - banned substance list. - [Nolan] banned substance list. -
good friends LDS. - Yeah, great people. well, know, just
kind set facts, know. folks use MDMA don't,
not, know, problem people using drugs, poly substance
users, right? can't say MDMA also taken psychedelics
taken opiates taken cocaine, picture
can't really tease problem. this, right, just individuals
part Mormon faith. kind purist sense used
MDMA confirmed that. brilliant study, right?


able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture

structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used

Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

able go look cognitive profiles versus individuals
geography, faith, that, happened not take MDMA found
no neurocognitive differences. - mean not damaging? -
not damaging. hard know really study well,
track folks ever took MDMA pre-post compare
people didn't. But, know, good study can do, given
situation, able check out. Additionally, back Charleston
working Medical University South Carolina, one mentors there, Dr.
Wagner, neuropsychologist MUSC also neuropsychologist
early MDMA trials. neurocognitive batteries individuals pre-
post similarly not see changes neurocognitive profiles negative way.
so, know, data experimental patients receiving this. data
people chronic users, know, take MDMA.
combination data suggests certainly no apparent risk kind one
two three dose range. probably unlikely least, know, modest dose
exposure lifetime doesn't appear profound neurocognitive damaging
effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, know sourcing key here, talking
clinical trials purity assured. know, years ago so-called
raves really popular, maybe still popular, never one, wouldn't
know happening not. know am. clear that,
know, testing purity important sometimes drugs made
contaminants like methamphetamine, know highly neurotoxic.
think one reason people think MDMA might neurotoxic reported
drop energy sort feeling fatigued days afterward. spoke physician
colleague said likely something surge
prolactin arrives subsequent big dopamine surge occurs MDMA.
mention know number people talk serotonin depletion
taking MDMA. mind true, likely anytime
somebody takes something something huge lift dopamine,
likely huge compensatory increase prolactin follows
prolactin kind sedative effect, numbing effect mood libido, et cetera,
eventually also wears off. make sense physician? - Yeah, makes
sense. mean, know, difference between, say, MDMA psilocybin
MDMA kind amphetamine sorts, right? effects dopamine


psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity

people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.

South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within

including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind

significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details

health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic

want start off saying please come back teach us

Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...

right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

psilocybin's, know, pretty neutral, know, maybe little bit dopamine
effects, kind much serotonergic focused drug. yeah, think
going see kind different profile after.

01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment

makes, haven't heard story, makes sense too. - Since
mentioned psilocybin, talk little bit neurochemistry psilocybin.
serotonergic agent, understanding operates these, 5HT serotonin 2C
receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A receptors. seen bunch
different reports terms actually brain people
effects drug. important us segment
effects happen people influence long lasting
effects. effects heard are, instance, tell
right wrong, increased activation lateral connection, sort
broader areas brain coactive normally occur. Maybe
explains synesthesias, know, seeing sounds hearing colors
trivial example, rule breaking within mind. also heard
perhaps lack gating sensory input. normally looking something,
not thinking sensation right toe unless relevant. thinking
sensation right toe, generally not thinking truck around
corner. attentional spotlights, somehow creates more,
adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates thalamus. - Degates thalamus, right,
particular thalamic structure. evidence true?
phenomena? involvement dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
aware of? really headed minutes is, know,
place combining directed stimulation brain psychedelics
effects serotonin primarily within structures know work
relevant depression. So, simplify first, going one takes
psilocybin interesting light depression? - Yeah, definitely. David
Nutt Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics kind
first folks work. great surprise, thought going
increase activity psychedelics found opposite, right?
kind overall decrease level activity brain psychedelics,


also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity
change also see TMS approaches, right? connectivity
subgenual anterior cingulate default mode network.
effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, see
regulation, connectivity them, negatively balanced mood state case
depressed individuals self-representation brain. see
connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, know, suggesting convergent
mechanism makes sense, right? kind got overconnected, negatively
balanced system, conflict system kind attached onto self representation
people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.

South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant

including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details

just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

also looked connectivity kind small world, know,
large world connectivity think about. so, know, small world meaning
kind much kind focused kind cortical function or, know, sub-
cortical function whatever is. see difference level
engagement brain regions, connectivity, kind global connectivity, point,
kind increases. so, know, interesting, know, think kind
conversion theory this. still, know, determined. still lot work
think needs done. certainly suggestive pretty profound
changes brain activity brain connectivity after. found really
interesting anti-depressant effects psilocybin particular connectivity

people feel stuck, right?

01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment

whatever effective, unpairs two systems. -
want ask phenomenon heard psilocybin journeys.
heard Dr. Matthew Johnson, running lot clinical trials
Johns Hopkins guest podcast. said something
seems important patient depressed influence
psilocybin patient trying get smoking eating disorder
taking psilocybin clinic. something important notion
letting go, people will feel thoughts feelings maybe even
body aren't control, clinicians' job
circumstances course make sure physically safe don't jump
window try... Actually give example patient thought that, think
she, move painting wall, obviously wasn't true


real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just


mention people want regulate sleep, sleep toolkit

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot

buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

real world, although true mind. prevented that.
letting go, somehow untethering autonomic arousal occurring
important. brings us back idea back idea like seesaw
sort letting go hinge just sort of, heart rate's going up,
like just go trust, know? heart rate's going down, just go
trust. thinking something powerful depressing related
childhood, just supposed go without fear. thinking
possible terms happen. anyway, get picture. Can think
just willingness million different variations emotional Stroop
task? know, entertain full array rules within head consider
them. something it? know, again, outer margins
understanding here, thoughts notion letting go
key variable relief depression psychedelic journey? - Yeah, talk
little bit something called exposure response prevention therapy,
typical kind gold standard treatment OCD, help little bit conceptually.
really is, letting go therapy. so, know, exposure response
prevention, idea expose individual something that,
know, something triggers obsession want whatever
compulsion is, right? give you, know, first exposure response
prevention patient resident, concerned leaving lights
car. went turned lights car
locked door. lights on, super worried, going kill
battery. went spent hour talking things, went back
car battery fine, lights on. cranked car
maybe one time, sudden gone, right?
idea that, know, essentially exposing. want levels
are, anxiety standpoint, tolerable, exposing person something
letting see exposure ends fine, right? ends not causing
thing end worried about. so, know, sense,
psychedelic state, taught level retain level control.
know, people less that, effectively retaining level
control. wake morning put clothes go society. try
say, know, people try say right things. don't try things
outside cultural norms conversation. constantly


level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

level controlling situation in. it's, know, not, makes
lot sense state, part therapeutic effect may linked
neural circuitry idea letting go essentially letting system, know,
network configuration maybe, whatever is, assume state essentially
fighting whole time. way OCD patient fighting need
click off button lights car 50 times go whatever
needed do. level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn
lights not anything, letting go meaning psychedelic state,
just letting go whatever holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts
setting depression or, know, re-experiencing trauma
memory allowing just happen seeing different light.
know, feels sense allowing whatever's going
psychedelic states whatever do. - fascinating. said exposure
response therapy traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention
therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside psychedelic journey. - done
outside psychedelic journey. idea letting go present those.
know, psychotherapy kind straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non
anything psycho manualized, psychotherapy know works really well
OCD. then, know, psychedelic state, people done studies
psilocybin, now studies MDMA trying look treating OCD,
know, sort idea letting go, right? OCD
patient kind let go? Maybe even letting go not washing hands anymore,
know, kind accepting idea not going get germs hands
whatever is, know?

01:41:23 Normal Spectrums Mental Health Disorders

kind part parcel, sort thinking. - college,
developed compulsive superstition. not afraid admit this. somehow developed
knock wood superstition. actually kind ashamed
rationally made no sense. don't consider superstitious person, never
superstitious kid. know, step sidewalk cracks, walk ladders,
know, probably even try walk ladder, even though don't suggest it.
somehow picked thing used sneak times. told girlfriend


time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

time hopes prevent it. tricky.
Sometimes actually comes back think, gosh, didn't say, know, knock
wood, didn't knock wood, hope doesn't actually happen. quote
unquote crazy, right? crazy sense makes no sense rationally
events linked. yet think lot people internal
superstitions. Maybe talking now, it'll go away. Clearly just need challenge
it. know, anyway, mention consider myself, know, generally
rational person, interesting motor patterns get activated notion
letting go, don't actually know consequence fear. fear,
hearing example gave, know, fear car battery running down,
say, "Well, battery actually run out?" therapy
undermined. yet also interesting too, not big
deal. jump car. case, need think ultimate fear is. -
Yeah, know, think lot people, interesting look at, say, OCD
scale depression scale whatever, don't define normal zero. define
normal number range above. zero to, case Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, one depression scales use, 10, right?
normal range. people sadness still considered normal.
case OCD scale, 10, right? say kind
starts be, know, mildly abnormal something. always tell medical
students, "Look, friends surf instructors, like zero Y
bar. People professionals, know, non-zero, still within
normal range." especially, know, case talking about, doesn't
sound like got way. doesn't sound, mean, obviously highly successful
tenured professor Stanford great things do.
much kind within normal range, think totally assumed lot people
sorts things. long, think something psychiatric diagnosis
severely impairs ability function kind cross
threshold. But, know, think lot people, great bringing
up. mean, anti-stigmatizing bringing up, right? think
lot people hold stuff don't want talk worried
somebody else may think something. reality is, psychiatrist, talk
lot patients, lot people are, know, family members, know, folks
just going death family, whatever is. figure


like, everybody's got little something there. Everybody knock
way, makes sense. just, just kind predisposed not
talk it. think important talk think start
talking it, realize kind together way.
folks knock 100 times, call OCD, know,
worried germs things. call OCD.
circumstance, know, need treatment, right? really on, just like blood
sugar, just like blood pressure, range, know,

01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
think anesthetic. going dentist, unpleasant experience
me, generally. ibogaine? anything so-called toad?
know, people talk smoking frog skin, toad skin. used clinically?
legal US clinical tool? using purposes?
educate ibogaine, truly know nothing it, except think know spell
correctly. - Yeah, fair, yeah. ibogaine one alkaloids can
extract iboga tree root bark typically growing country Gabon,
Africa. Gabon one West African countries, kind middle Africa
west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

not just discreet diagnoses. don't. - good
know. actually feel relief just hearing this, slightly... wouldn't say
ashamed sort embarrassed it, offer a, know, is,
say. certainly doesn't seem hinder life much, knock wood. - [Nolan]
[laughs] Nice. - talk bit ibogaine. don't know much
ibogaine, although anytime hear the, know, A-I-N-E, know, lidocaine, ibogaine,

west coast. Gabon group folks, know, called Bwiti.
religious kind sacramental group sacramentally uses iboga root bark part
sacrament. using iboga root bark long time. it's,
know, part tradition. whole set kind ceremony around it.
interested this, book called "Breaking Open Head" Daniel Pinchbeck
goes talks whole process. essentially Gabonese
using long time kind atypical psychedelic. not
psychedelic normally think psilocybin LSD visual
perceptual changes, right? take psilocybin LSD, experience


experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind

return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change

health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

experience kind visual perceptual differences external world, right?
enough LSD psilocybin, individual can actually perceive something visually
external world isn't there, talked earlier. Ibogaine doesn't that.
Ibogaine something different. kind like, ever seen "Minority Report,"
know, movie Tom Cruise, think 15 20 years ago something?
dates us little bit, movie able go see
kind pre crimes. big screen look scenes time
like kind go scene see it. individuals taking ibogaine
will say open eyes, don't see anything, closed eyes, go back
re-experience earlier life memories will able experience
place empathy, not themselves, others, kind detached
empathy able see almost third party, even though there.
able see it, know, third party. Claudia Naranjo, psychiatrist
Argentina, described lot books wrote, think '80s '90s
around this. so, know, ibogaine's around long time. Howard Lotsof,
American guy brought Africa. polysubstance user, used every
drug get hands on, took ibogaine, including lot
psychedelics, way, took ibogaine never another drug again,
supposedly profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine no way
recreational substance. not recreational substance want
recreational substance, essentially this, call life review.
also call 10 years psychotherapy night. terminology
people talk issue. - long last? truly one night? - usually,
know, can go, depending upon get re-dosed anything, go sometimes,
depending upon fast metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
Sometimes can shorter, long time. long time. definitely
longest acting psychedelic substance know of. people, will take this,
reevaluation given memory. talking
earlier, reconsolidate memory again, seems have, know, effect
reconsolidation process. so, know, five, four, five years ago,
tapped Robert Malenka, one senior neuroscientists know
university. says, "Well, unnamed donor interested
funding scientific, kind open label study Navy SEALs going
Mexico taking ibogaine also 5-MeO-DMT," talk


second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

second, treat PTSD. know, claim traumatic brain injury, depression,
know, whole constellation symptoms. know, described
various people done this, spouses whatnot, know,
John, just say John, John couldn't screw light bulb light fixture, right?
just debilitated couldn't simple tasks, call activities daily
living. coming back really dramatic improvements
aspects life. so, know, last couple years able
first human, kind full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation
ibogaine doing. case, special operations, special forces individuals, former
Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, kind crew folks, look pre-post
changes experience able totally quantitate that.
able capture clinical scales, know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. executive function
work specifically? verbal memory, that? neuroimaging
EEG. will first human study ibogaine those. reason
ibogaine kind the... seemingly potent
seemingly, least, powerful psychedelic, one risk
too, cardiac effect. seems can screen people
risk off electrocardiogram reduce risk quite bit.
did. people haven't really studied much. isn't as,
addition, nobody goes rave ibogaine. no recreation this. -
not fun. - It's, people say relieving, hard work, right? yeah,
reexamining things. know, see folks after,
tell you, know, haven't fully analyzed data yet, tell that, know,
folks telling me, pretty dramatic. know, people come back
lot better. lot better. nobody, knock wood,
nobody's sort cardiac issue cohort studied
look lot better feel lot better too. describe experiences
able go back and, know, soldiers experienced something called
moral injury, right? maybe accidentally blew something kid
something like that. know, Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, know,
child died accident maybe civilian died whatever was, right? suffer
moral injuries part job. almost one kind vocational risks.
come back say forgiven themselves, know, huge,


right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

right? part able see different light
empathy finally able kind experience
forgiving. so, cool. study, know, happening
taking ibogaine taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call Toad,
Sonoran River Toad. think like can find Mexico, find 'em
Arizona. back toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,
flavor DMT produces particular psychedelic effect also used sacrament. -
dimethyltryptamine? - 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. kind
dimethyltryptamine kind addition it. deal lasts longer
traditional DMT. know, like 20 minutes five, three, whatever kind thing.
guys taking ibogaine take 5-MeO-DMT after.
kind divorce two things able study just
understand ibogaine doing. go back month later
5-MeO-DMT. - two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two
completely separate sessions. - one quick question ibogaine bit
5-MeO-DMT. ibogaine journey guided, person just closes
eyes just start falling back catalog memories? - bunch
preparatory sessions, bunch sessions able
kind rehash things. During, sitter sits kind sits
helps out, not, pretty, phenomenon drug seems drive
lot this, right? lot ends call supportive psychotherapy.
just kind and, know, maybe holding person's hand,
maybe just saying "I'm here," maybe whatever is, making sure
know around. not really interaction per se. whole kind
goal just get folks kind go back

01:57:16 Clinical Use Psychedelics

reexamine memories ultimately look like reconsolidate them.
know, interesting. mean, kind of, said earlier, Timothy
Leary kind sociocultural construct ends overlaid psychedelics.
think rid preconceived notions
isn't, counterculture movement, stuff neither us ever involved
in, neither us ever partake in, know, kind straight scientists looking


this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts
things thinking SSRIs, psychotherapy, kind
combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs substance kind allows
reexamine things. interesting. lot try figure
true, know? can say stands right now, don't know
statement true, right? lot work needs happen statement
proven true. hypothesis is, true, likely will
seen breakthrough allows sorts things
can't normal waking consciousness. also really think
this. And, know, drugs can't recreational drugs. really shouldn't
recreational drugs, right? really powerful used context
recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order
really make happen, understand need prescription
SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea
substances go outside strict medical supervision kind
preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,
going right, got way protected,
safe, make sure people know things not recreational really
pure purposes really powerfully changing cognition letting
people seem be, know, relatively therapeutic states. - think
great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant
species Amazon. somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined
two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

this, right? can kind rid sociocultural constructions
reexamine this, just discovered today, say sorts drugs
huge breakthrough psychiatry allow us lot sorts

recreation can put states. generation
psychedelic researchers really clear that. know, think '60s folks
not clear that, felt like whole kind cultural thing
going there. think cohort individuals really understands order

SSRI, doesn't change consciousness whole lot, worried
that, doctor evaluate every week, idea

preposterous actually. kind dumb moment, think, medicine say, look,

great study. along lines sort early iterations
psychedelics counterculture '60s '70s, took place, like
"One Flew Cuckoo's Nest" think actually based Menlo Park VA,
neighborhood Stanford. things quite bit different now. know
spent time operators former operators event,
last Veterans Day, fact, so-called Veteran Solutions group pioneering
lot psychedelic treatments former special operators current special
operators. interesting contrast counterculture


movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

movement '60s '70s, room filled people much
structure, military. Right? no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-
military, pro-military. isn't just one group people exploring
psychedelics treatment trauma PTSD things. course
also domains society looking this. fact, were,
really interesting far left far right politicians event
stage together, talking about, kind lighter terms, heart medicine, also talking
neurobiology talking. just fascinating perspective somebody
trying learn stuff, psychedelic therapies no longer sit within
anti-establishment realm. independent that, certainly people military
adopting potential treatment. Again, still exploration,

02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study

also exploration universities like Stanford Johns Hopkins UCSF
University College London on. Along lines tree barks toad
skins, tell ayahuasca. plant, know, intriguing. pro-
serotonergic drug like psilocybin? useful sorts conditions
talked thus far? perhaps tell little bit also
Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca another psychedelic.
used sacrament Brazil Peru Ecuador, Columbia. lot
South American countries. combine two plants together,
one plant two plant combination effectively nothing, two plant
combination together capable producing profound psychedelic effect.
really kind curious are, understand it, 10 20,000 plant

two plants together certain proportionality cooked five, 10 hours
point cook dimethyltryptamine one plants cook
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant way
reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents GI breakdown
dimethyltryptamine way allowed cross blood-brain barrier
get brain. didn't add reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
plant derived combination, never cross brain. put people
standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor wasn't reversible,


throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just


mention people want regulate sleep, sleep toolkit

things toolkit based work Stanford Sleep Laboratories,

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

throw serotonin syndrome, right? kind like sweet spot
somehow ayahuasca practitioners found able get DMT brain
oral source combination monoamine oxidase inhibitor curious.
substance explored antidepressant agent, studies
looked that. also seems safe. psychiatrist UCLA
Harbor done lot work this, looked children even
exposed kind small doses ayahuasca kind sacrament within
Amazonian tribes found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects
adults. appears safe. kind part brought various religions,
including kind merged Catholicism South America, kind
interesting. so, know, sects Catholicism Brazil, used
sacrament religious ceremonies. became interesting Brazilian
researchers whether not affect recidivism rates prisoners
Brazilian prisons, right? gave half prisoners, know, sort inert
substance half prisoners ayahuasca session. recidivism rate
return prison rate ayahuasca exposed individuals statistically
significantly lower recidivism rate control group, suggesting that,
know, whatever going seems effect whatever drives criminal
behavior, whatever criminal behavior happened be. don't details
exact nature crime. know, also no way saying
just giving psychedelics folks prison that. think edgy
thing probably not something anybody try, kind bring
curious question drive people change
behaviors people make behavioral decisions? lot times
look prisons United States, know, people say this, biggest mental
health facility United States? prison.

02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses

- Yeah, lot unpack sure. know, homeless issue, prison
issue. lead something heard recently, related this,
cannabis. know, hear lot nowadays people will say, well, safer
alcohol. episode alcohol that, least read literature,
indeed alcohol seem quite bad health beyond... think pretty clear


not drinking better health drinking all. here, not trying
tell people do, data say. forget studies red
wine. drink much red wine get enough resveratrol. not even clear
resveratrol anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis
now available lot high potency forms. People vaping cannabis, people
smoking cannabis. certainly not saying cannabis bad people
necessarily, although think children, hope brain development
completed first, know, get age 25. know sounds late lot people,
THC obviously taps endogenous systems cannabinoid
systems powerful. seen report Lancet Psychiatry last
year said early use potent cannabis, meaning age 14 20 so, can
potentially lead exacerbation psychosis later life. actually put
social media sort exploded. didn't expect to. people saying, well,
not causal. obviously not causal people say, well, maybe people
psychotic tendencies seeking cannabis. Although sort weak
argument sense least 4X increase psychotic episodes
people later life. thoughts cannabis? want
acknowledge medical benefits certain things, pain, chemotherapy.
no means trying knock cannabis appropriate medicinal use.
think cannabis terms finding can exacerbate
psychosis certain individuals? - Yeah, think, know, couple things,
right? cannabis multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and,
know, indicas, gets, yeah, lot unpack. - Yeah, lot.
two main kind chemicals think kind things
essentially bred, right? so, know, lot cannabis really bred
high, potent THC. cannabis THC's bred completely
out. stories, know, Colorado, right? strain cannabis
THC free, no THC all, CBD, called Charlotte's Web.
bunch kids' parents, one kid, kind string parents moved
Colorado cannabis legalized, CBD antiepileptic, CBD also
antipsychotic. number studies give CBD high
doses, antipsychotic established schizophrenic patients. issue
bred CBD marijuana selectively time. gotten good figuring
that, right? Conversely, THC pro psychotic pro epileptic, right?


talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just


mention people want regulate sleep, sleep toolkit

things toolkit based work Stanford Sleep Laboratories,

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

talk cannabis cause psychosis cannabis treat psychosis,
appears related proportions CBD THC kind
idea cannabis. me, no stock anything like that,
company called GW Pharmaceuticals, haven't looked while,
lot clinical trials something called Dravet Syndrome, seizure
disorder kids seize whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizure
disorder, kids seizing 300 times day. like kids seizing
much, basically seizure postictal phase constantly.
failed everything. failed barbiturates, failed bromides, just don't
use anymore except cases side effects. give kids
CBD. think CBD pretty safe drug compared bromide, right? idea
CBD kid actually safe, cannabinoid, CBD safe, right?
totally fine. Also giving CBD adjunctive treatment
schizophrenia. positive trials negative trials that,
seems no negative side effects. seems reduce metabolic
syndrome issues folks schizophrenia side effects
primary antipsychotic. converse is, clearly cases people
taking high doses THC become psychotic, get put psychiatric unit,
nothing happens kind get THC system,
resolve psychosis, right? that, know, handful people
seizures related high doses THC syncope sorts things.
idea THC, high doses THC can pro psychotic, also not taking shot
people think cannabis overall good thing. just, just is.
kind pure, think zoom back say true naturalist, thinking
natural medicines world, think, well, probably marijuana
balanced THC CBD point, humans messed it, right?
likely, probably okay level, pushed one way
another. mean okay 45 year old, okay, kind thing. Now,
think going kids, teenagers, got prefrontal maturation,
right? exposing whole lot high THC load.
unclear cause effect, certainly picture. parent, wouldn't
want 16 year old smoking marijuana. parent 30 year old,
otherwise healthy, totally fine, know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided try
marijuana first time, wouldn't scold it, right? think kind


different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

different thing, right? never want 25 year old, just like saying,
prefrontal maturation, never want kid exposed all. looks
like, except susceptible individuals susceptible drug-induced psychosis,
looks like, know, relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. know,
again, not going comment cause effect, say that, know,
parent, doesn't make much sense, right? never know ultimately
going hurt kid. mean, talking earlier, wife's pregnant
now. kind avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right?

02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol

idea just, want careful children's brains developing.
think really saying think actually important. bigger
question asked, relative risks drugs, interesting one. David
Nutt published in, think "The Lancet," look up, think "The
Lancet," article relative drug risks person society.
like, UK's like British Drug Policy Group, essentially
showed look societal risk plus personal risk, combine two,
know drug dangerous drug world? - going guess
alcohol. - alcohol, right behind heroin cocaine da da da da da,
somewhere middle marijuana. right tail end, exact end
this, psilocybin. - caffeine, usually doesn't make list. - may
list. was, probably pretty close psilocybin, somewhere middle
ketamine, somewhere middle amphetamine, somewhere the, know,
little closer psilocybin, think MDMA, know. combined personal
kind world risk things. alcohol makes it, huge
amount personal risk huge amount societal risk, right? Drunk drivers
kill X amount people world. - Fight, sexual assault, that. - that, yeah.
cancer stuff. beats cocaine, beats heroin,
beats things. yet, don't, culture, whatever reason,
don't culture see drug. part really baffles me, know? -
mean, serve it. mean, no knock Stanford all. course, wouldn't
that. every institution to, serve alcohol graduate student
events. - [Nolan] right. - know, serve alcohol. happy hour.


never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone

never drinker. can take leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - realize
people, really enjoy alcohol. know, former partner, mean, just
10% people glass wine just feel great.
second one, feel great. just want take nap bit alcohol, never
much me. always feel poisoned. feel lucky sense. unbelievable
prevalent just, baked medical, even medical institutions,
pop bottle champagne celebrate opening hospital. - [Nolan]
right, right. - know, pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, absolutely right.
know, think going happen, me, know, looking crystal ball
little bit, think going happen happened doctors
smoking. look '50s '60s, right? pictures
doctors smoking cigarettes, know, patients or, know, psychiatrists
psychotherapy smoking cigarette patient sitting couch, know,
surgeons smoking cigarette cases, pictures that,
right? now sudden, smoking's totally banned. think totally banned
Stanford campus. suspicion is, suggesting, right? know,
everywhere kind ubiquitous. critical point, tipping point,
everybody's going realize that, just like smoking, got rid hospital systems
universities alcohol. point 50 years, view look
back scenarios talking like, know what,
foolish this. can't believe gave people alcohol graduated
whatever, know? think different take it, going take
longer time. think people really good job tying smoking lung cancer like
simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, know? Now, know, alcohol
increases risk lot different cancers. Not clear one. mean,
like, know, kind oral, like throat, tongue cancer, one of- - Breast
cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, know? kind just, harder story
tell, know? think why, everybody, know,
whole, it's, know, mom says this. like drank glass wine
doctor told heart healthy. talking this, try to, no, no,
no, Dr. So-and-so said heart healthy. ends thing like
drinking alcohol thinks good heart. And, know,
hard. conversations her. hard untie that. think
that, yeah, point going hit threshold moment. it'll


interesting really look data really look safe not safe
purely analysis, kind points right direction. - really interesting.
also say nothing poor judgment influence alcohol. mean,
venture remove alcohol university campuses, watch, students
going lobby say this. remove alcohol
campuses, mean, just think suspect improvement good
decision making. occur. Or, know, got stories graduate
school and... different, know, 10 years ago. lot alcohol
consumption. Again, never thing, know people make really bad
decisions.

02:20:42 Circadian Reset Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light

case, whole landscape emerging. think got finger right
pulse it. want touch something slightly different
talking about, definitely related depression. this, again, one
intriguing perplexing things, sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet personally familiar fact don't sleep well
one night don't sleep all, fact, ability function pretty well next
day. non-sleep deep rest practice blab lot Huberman Lab
Podcast, tremendously restorative, like good night's sleep. think
everybody understands now, thanks great work Matthew Walker others
really gotten world saying, look, foundation mental health,
physical health, high performance, thing, functional human
being, try get enough quality deep sleep least 80% nights life,
can. something focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise
social connection, et cetera. sleep deprivation, know, particular, think rapid
eye movement components sleep deprivation can improve symptoms
depression. yet sleep deprived can also really disregulate control
autonomic system. notice night two night three poor sleep, going
stressful phase happening, sudden heart rate chronically
elevated, thought patterns become really disrupted. can't exercise,
decision making thrown off, emotionality labile. hinge,
referring earlier, feels less control, control. maybe wonder


sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make
complicated neuroscience kind brain-body science accessible, know,
way gift do. think important show
much help science literacy. yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you.

without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot
friends, folks not medical profession, friends mine, know, one
buddies real estate agent works us, big, big fan show.
know, told couple people like coming like super
stoked. like, know, watch every show and, know, super excited
watch mine. said something important that, know, make

sometimes enter state refer earlier, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex no longer leading cingulate, cingulate now charge. players
charge coach. Not good situation. know done work
sleep deprivation light effects. Please tell us please tell us
triple therapy. that? - Yeah, yeah. friend mine, Greg Salem, another one
professors Stanford, interested sleep. bunch training
sleep went medical school got interested idea that,
saying, sleep deprive somebody one night just kind isolated single
night, end sleep deprivation, will antidepressant effect,
soon fall asleep, lose it. depressed individual, can get
less depressed acutely. Soon fall asleep, wake eight hours later,
come back level depression. idea
needed sort circadian reset. part depression is,
dysregulated circadian system. mentors mine say, can just get
sleep better, half battle dealing depression. 'Cause many people
insomnia around depression whole host types insomnia.
hard time falling asleep, waking middle night, waking earlier,
symptoms depression. sleep deprives individual
certain calculation shifting phase simultaneously exposing
bright lights. triple, phase shift, sleep deprivation,
bright light, try get circadian rhythm. Essentially theory reintrained.
so, know, trials done trials prior after,
know, looked like pretty profound antidepressant effect triple
therapy seemed durable, meaning durability term use say not
can get kind point relief, relief ends up, know, lasting.
important know like, shouldn't home sure.
need professional, 'cause complicated, not just one thing.
sleep deprivation, seems antidepressant, pro anxiety. take
highly anxious person not depressed sleep deprive them, get
profoundly anxious. thing really realize
like everything else talked today, things
medical supervision, curious, right? think, know, question
always comes isn't used more? think reason not
really mechanism for, know, ultimately medicine, sad is,


code thing. code associated treatment
hard figure make code this. think part it.
way, somebody's got kind take baton that, way
make code this, know, think actually turn something
widely utilized. And, know, probably dream ways integrate
AI, passive sensing, stuff really make work. think
idea, trajectory see, so, yeah. - Yeah, billable insurance
code fundamental. lot listeners podcast, think, background
engineering science. will put link manuscript talks triple
therapy, talking one night sleep deprivation, timed light
exposure eyes, shifting circadian clock central themes
podcast come often. think typical person, can say trying
get regular light dark cycle sleep rhythm beneficial overall mood
regulation? - Yeah, think typical person, know, really kind reregulating
sleep trying get, know, good night's sleep fall asleep, stay
asleep, wake set time every morning going pretty crucial. know,
mild depression, think one lot control that. talking
earlier, think hit threshold depression things become kind
semi-volitional harder kind will that. therapies like,
know, CBT insomnia, instance, can cognitive
behavioral therapy help insomnia. Sometimes people, no sleep expert.
Kind pass Greg fully talk this, goes people
kind milder insomnia experience like blue light computer things
like that, can use like blue light blockers to, tricks brain, know better
me, tricks brain think still light outside. people will still
insomnia brain still thinks light outside. people will,
know, kind strict CBT sleep. know, therapists will say two
things bed. certain age whatnot,
really one thing bed, sleep
partner, right? kind two things bedroom.
really things bedroom sleep
problems. shouldn't watch TV bedroom, shouldn't eat bedroom,
shouldn't hang out. - Keep phone bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep phone
bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. get Greg Salem podcast. just


mention people want regulate sleep, sleep toolkit
available downloadable PDF hubermanlab.com. Just go menu lot
things toolkit based work Stanford Sleep Laboratories,

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get

non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage

different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects depression, coverage different
types depression, various therapeutic compounds, work. talked
lot things today. shared much knowledge, even say that,
much want back talk many things well didn't
time cover, also just really want thank work do. know
colleagues, run enormous laboratory, enormous book. 40
people big group, big group. Plus clinic, also life
outside work. take time sit us share
knowledge really service mental health human feeling better fact
avoiding often suicidal depression. just incredible work incredible generosity.
just thank much. - Oh, thank you, man. mean, know, similarly want
thank doing. mean, think you, know, got lot

things toolkit based work Stanford Sleep Laboratories,

02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study

including Jamie Zeitz others' lab, not aimed depression specifically. Listen, Nolan,
Dr. Williams, amazing voyage circuitry autonomic
control. landscape prefrontal cortex is, find incredibly fascinating just
want start off saying please come back teach us
TMS work. wrap, however, want give opportunity talk
SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - SAINT SAINTS plural? -
Yeah, SAINT. SAINT, calling SNT now. SAINT has, know...
intent not kind connect religion, may accidentally done so.
abbreviated SNT subsequent trials, initially Stanford
Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, now calling Stanford
Neuromodulation Therapy. idea there, cool idea, TMS
device delivers treatment, treatment protocol. protocol
stimulation parameter set specific brain region specific condition.
cool neuromodulation, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation, like Casey Halpern
talked another podcast, idea cases, device
physical layer conduit stimulation protocol therapeutic given condition
given brain region. case depression, know
TMS, TMS studies depression for, know, since 1995,
right? clearance 2000, 2008, 2009. timeframe, able go
really knowing little something like getting FDA
clearance. way went two groups studying
different components NIH. first group studying mood neuroanatomy
functional imaging. kind first generation functional imaging back then,
PET scans, kind metabolic scans, SPECT scans. idea
looking activity metabolism prefrontal cortex. found
kind crude scans just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
group right upstairs National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke,


NINDS, looking using TMS, around 10 years,
repetitively stimulating motor cortex. found was, gosh, can get
readout thumb muscle movement amplitude really reproducible across people.
like, know, universally reproducible. certain stimulation approaches,
biologically active either increase excitability, IE thumb motion, set
intensity goes up, amount amplitude goes up, inhibitory depotentiating,
goes biological stimulation approaches. third outcome,
important, inert, doesn't either. can stimulation
approaches one, know, increase activity, decrease activity, inert.
found was, oh, can excite certain brain regions. mentor, Mark
George said, kind aha moment said, "Wow, underactivity
prefrontal cortex depression, can increase activity using thing
know can increase activity motor cortex. just need put left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex." combined two started stimulating
day kind abbreviated fashion. lo behold,
depression patients resolved depression. back then, still today, can go
psychiatric patient stay National Institute Mental Health go
clinical trials try get treated. patients who'd
months able discharged. mood better, yeah.
just crude approach using ruler measurements DLPFC
was, stimulating devices needed physically dunk coil
ice bath. that, still able to, kind genius this, Mark
others, still able create purely engineered stimulation approach.
cool kind found two things, right? found one
stimulation protocol antidepressant effect. limited, doesn't
treat everybody, antidepressant effect. bigger concept
neuromodulation device kind like pharmaceutical company you, right?
given individual, TMS device whatever neuromodulation device able
generate, can create stimulation approach specific given condition
specific individual. physical layer just exert that, similarly
make pharmaceutical drugs pharmaceutical company.

02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation



actual therapy do, it. learned
from, know, another 20, 30 years can modify stimulation
protocol way can create whole new treatment put
TMS device or, thank god, evolved version don't
dunk ice baths can actually really handle much aggressive
stimulation approaches. 2005, group published "Neuron" paper
demonstrating stimulate hippocampal rhythms TMS coil,
can excite brain memory rhythms it'll last hour. can change
cortical excitability thumb twitch hour, sending three minutes excitatory
40 seconds case inhibitory stimulation mimics hippocampal rhythms.
much efficient original TMS approaches. so, know,
group tried kind six week schedule, that, know,
that, decided, gosh, know, problem talked
beginning show problem don't treatment
people high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? idea
going engineer treatment can reorganize stimulation approach
time much efficient utilizing something called space learning theory.
probably know space learning theory. idea viewers
is, simple psychological thing, also seen hippocampal slice sort
physiology too, cramming test, write 60 note cards
read one minute get first note card again,
hour later, right? just intuitively this. all, know, automatically
that. intuit know doesn't work writing one
note card looking again. Nobody ever that, right? know,
graduate school, medical school, big stacks note
cards. space learning theory. idea need see every hour
hour half optimizes learning. take stimulation
approach talking about, data burst stimulation approach, take
hippocampal slice mouse stimulate, enlarge dendritic spines
prime some. stimulate right that, don't get change.
called mass stimulation. wait hour hour half, get
dendritic spines enlarged primed. Which, way, also
ketamine does, causes dendritic spine enlargement. so, know,
found old way TMS, idea just day, every


day, five days week six weeks, didn't utilize space learning theory. like
studying month two, just little bit day. Like remember
stuff, like not potent week kind cramming, right?
realized reorganize stimulation time took
whole six week course, actually figured way day.
also figured people underdosing TMS just keep going
six weeks month three, four, five, people got better.
figured not just one day, going give five times normal dose.
going 7 1/2 months' worth five days using space learning theory. - every
hour? - [Nolan] Every hour 10 hours. - five days. - five days. 50 hour
block. 90 minutes actual stimulation, spread day
way learning. perfect inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five
days manageable. - Yeah, can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped
schedule. know, folks want this, want it. nine
minutes, go get breakfast, nine minutes, go see
therapist whatever is. found reorganization time
stimulation dose, third component resting state functional
connectivity scans everybody. ways now last five 10 years
picking specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit talking earlier,
cingulate DLPFC, can pick every single one. want come
lab, can find DLPFC subgenual. even robust non- - Maybe
stimulate too, just there. - Yeah, want to, can move around
hypnotizability. can find spot person. Instead finding
spot skull, find spot brain, can stimulate.
every hour hour. found folks will, within one
five days, know, cases not, depending upon looking
open label trials, somewhere 60 90% time, will go full
remission sense totally normal mood standpoint end
this. like said, variable durability. part figure now
dosing keep people well. people, know,
four years remission, know, year remission. really cramming
test. really idea laying information exact right spot.
signal simple signal, profound one, turn on, stay on, remember
stay on. know, idea sending memory signal brain


way telling system, kind taking
hippocampus' hand sending signal hippocampus
normally signals out. Now sending signal prefrontal cortex kind
utilizing brain's communication style get get state.
cool people, kind exit that, end saying
don't side effects it. feel back normal. Like people,
know, not everybody, subsection people SSRIs
say, kind feel numb, GI side effects, can't, know, don't
sexual interest used sort thing. know, not anything
SSRIs, said earlier, life saving, know, subsection people,
things really work. this, see people don't talk
stuff. think likely tapping core circuitry
reversing magnet that, profound
electromagnet, field strength MRI scanner, able induce
current brain focal targeted way without getting rest brain,
without getting rest body all. just really kind acting
circuitry involved. - Incredible. SAINT study still ongoing? people
interested potentially patients subjects study, can provide
portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. have, now treatment, students
went company called Magnus Medical, working this,
got FDA clearance now. now folks can get trials next
couple years going take time company kind get
running get device get whole thing set nationally.
going on, still 1,000 patients need recruited across bunch
different trials country. take people anywhere country.
also partners New York San Diego soon South Carolina
places can actually kind of, know, lab can help kind let
people know go, based off US, get access
able trial. tried make even get
the, know, 50 50 chance, going get real deal going get
non-real deal. figured way let everyone access.
got not real deal version, kind sham version fake version, first
part trial, trials can access real version.
essentially everybody eventually gets access real version.


big thing want everybody comes one trials
able access. think important. company's
lab's doing, kind nationally partner labs doing. - Well,
can assure you, going get interest. - [Nolan] Happy it, yeah. -
Thank you. listen, thank much taking us incredible voyage
