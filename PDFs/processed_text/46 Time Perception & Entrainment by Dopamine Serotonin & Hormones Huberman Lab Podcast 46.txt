Light seen eyes inhibits, meaning reduces, amount hormone released
brain called melatonin. Melatonin two major functions. One function

amount melatonin released. fact, wake middle night,
melatonin typically pretty high brain body flip bright light

powerful modulator melatonin light inhibits melatonin. Throughout year,
depending live, day length varies, consequence, amount
light sun available varies. days long, amount
melatonin brain body released tends less. less
released shorter amounts time, okay? light inhibits melatonin.
days short, amount melatonin released duration
melatonin exists brain body tends much longer. melatonin
correlates day length. viewing light, less melatonin.

00:21:13 Tool 4: Timing Physical Activity; Tool 5: Timing Eating Window



number different reasons. ways so-called entrain
circadian clock. One best ways engage physical activity fairly
regular times day. don't every day going exercise, try
exercise fairly consistent time day. Probably better exercise not
exercise, even move time day, light activity and, talk
third minute, food, major ways entrain internal perception
time external events world, meaning turning Earth
therefore exposure sunlight not. addition sunlight viewing

blue light, trying get activity, exercise fairly regular, within plus minus
two hours, day next going positive effect so-called
circadian entrainment, also eating fairly regular times. However, exciting.
data mainly point fact need eat within less time
window day, not always need eat meals exactly time.
don't necessarily eat lunch noon snack four dinner
eight order keep circadian entrainment aligned sharp.
instance small snack noon eat two dinner six
small snack eight. doesn't much matter exact meals fall much
fall less within consistent period phase 24-hour cycle.
happens circadian clock starts getting disrupted?

00:23:00 Circadian Entrainment Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers

mean, episode time perception. not episode
circadian rhythms entrainment. Well, classic study Aschoff done 1985
now repeated many times people go environments
didn't clocks didn't windows didn't
watches sometimes even constant dark constant light,
evaluated well people perceive passage time shorter timescales
found really interesting. found people underestimate long
isolated environments. 42 days so, ask people
long think here? people say 28 days 36 days.
generally underestimated long odd environment no
clocks watches exposure sunlight regular rhythms artificial light. addition,


found perception shorter time intervals also really disrupted.
ask measure off two minutes, normally people pretty good measuring
off two minutes. People come within, know, 5 15 seconds most. kind
sit just wait, pretty good idea two minutes up.
say two minutes up. Well, people's circadian clocks circadian
entrainment, say, disrupted, perception time measurement
shorter timescales minutes even seconds greatly disrupted. see
couple minutes, actually causes great problems contend work,
contend challenges different kinds. want circadian entrainment
pretty locked pretty entrained outside light-dark cycle
perception time shorter time intervals can precise ability
perceive time accurately given task given thing involved turns

00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus

one fundamental ways predicts well poorly perform
thing task. talked circannual entrainment, matching
cells tissues organs body 365-day journey Earth takes
around sun year talked circadian entrainment, way
24-hour genetic protein clocks every one cells matched
rotation Earth axis exposure lack exposure sun
rotation axis. Next like talk so-called ultradian entrainment.
Ultradian rhythms rhythms 90 minutes existence
broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. go sleep night, whether
not sleep six hours four hours eight hours 10 hours, entire period
sleep broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. Early night, tend
slow-wave sleep. Later night, tend REM sleep.
nonetheless, sleep broken 90-minute cycles. However,
wake morning, many things governed ultradian
rhythms. instance, work, meaning math try learn language
physical work kind work out, 90-minute time block seems
one brain can enter state focus alertness hard work
focus, focus, focus 90 minutes, significant drop ability
engage mental physical work. Now, everybody from, know, self-help


literature business literature pop psychology literature tried leverage
ultradian cycles saying going something hard want
focus it, limit 90 minutes less. one people also joined
conversation indeed use 90-minute work cycles, think extremely
powerful. One never expect going drop immediately state
high focus beginning remain 90 minutes. struggle
varying degrees achieve focus motivation drive within 90-minute
cycles. true, meaning ample literature support idea
90 minutes, tend go state less ability focus. isn't
time perception per se, example entrainment. entraining to,
right? Just can focus 90 minutes not well 100 minutes
120 minutes, entraining to? Well, entraining release
particular neurochemicals, case, acetylcholine dopamine allow brain
focus particular periods time, 90 minutes so, 90 minutes
so, amount chemicals can released tends drop low,
ability focus becomes diminished. one like explore
kind backbone basis ultradian rhythms, goes different name.
originally called basic rest-activity cycle. proposed many years
ago Nathaniel Kleitman. established true within sleep states
mentioned before. debated long time whether not 90-minute
cycles also control ability focus perform work wakeful states turns
do. Now lot literature support that. always get question
know 90 minute cycle begins? words, say wake
8 just finished 90-minute sleep cycle. mean next 90-
minute cycle work begins right 8:01? No, interesting thing
basic rest-activity cycles, ultradian rhythms, can initiate
whenever want. not like circadian rhythm hardwired
unerring signal 24 hours. ultradian rhythms occur sleep hardwired,
unerring. don't get option making sleep cycles 120 minutes five
minutes. don't get option. decide want apply ultradian
rhythms work performance, can set clock decide, okay, now focus
begins. Now work begins 90-minute cycle period going
work. actually this, know, mid morning sometimes twice day,
90-minute cycle limit distraction much possible, put away phone,


often turn off internet well. talked episode kind optimal
workday, least me, just give example might work. want
emphasize ultradian rhythms ones set. decide
going work 90 minutes. can't negotiate, however, 100
minutes 120 minutes, no matter are, going see diminishment
performance. not going focus well. way
90-minute cycles linked ability neurons release acetylcholine
dopamine extent norepinephrine, things give us narrow focus,
motivation, drive, way 90-minute cycles involved circuits.
90 minutes, circuits far less willing engage therefore
much harder continue focus high degree. people like multiple 90-
minute cycles per day focus. case, need separate out. can't
one 90-minute cycle, go right another 90-minute cycle, another 90-
minutes cycle. can't cheat circuits related acetylcholine dopamine
norepinephrine unfortunately. suggest people no three ideally
two just one 90-minute cycles. say ideally? Well,
taxing. narrow tunnel focus. me, can one mid
morning. can probably another one afternoon. not kind work
like checking email text messaging social media. focused hard
work, working hard problems various kinds, will different everybody.
recommend spaced least two four hours people
probably won't able handle two per day. probably
mutants three four, exceedingly rare. think even
one day going feel like significant mental investment, afterwards
going feel pretty taxed. now talked circannual,

00:31:42 Sense Passage Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective

circadian, ultradian rhythms, haven't really talked time perception per
se. mainly talked subconscious slow oscillatory ways
entrained matched year day ultradian cycles can
impose work can leverage toward focus like.
actual perception time? actually controls fast slowly
perceive time going by? basically three forms time perception


aware of. One perception passage time present,
quickly slowly things seem happening us. kind like interval timer
ticking off time. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. either fine-slicing like that, tick, tick,
tick. interval timers. discuss basis interval timers. also
engage called prospective timing like stopwatch measuring off things
go forward. might sound little bit like just described actually
little bit different. instance, told start measuring off two-minute time
interval future, pretty well. told measure
five-minute time interval future couldn't use clocks watches
phone anything like that, set tick marks.
decide many times going count off five-minute time block.
also retrospective time measure off time past. say,
know, last week, know went park, things friends,
know, went evening. long lunch went
dinner friends? probably think, okay, well, remember went dinner
seven lunch right around two. using memory reconstruct certain
sets events past get sense relative positioning within time, okay?
retrospective, current time interval measurements, prospective
time measurement future. beauty time perception human nervous
system boils couple simple molecules govern whether not
fine-slicing time whether not batching time larger bins.
molecules go names maybe heard, things like dopamine
norepinephrine, neuromodulators, called neuromodulators modulate,
change way neural circuits work. Also things like serotonin. Serotonin
released different site brain dopamine epinephrin
different effect time perception. just give example things like
dopamine

00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead Time Overestimation; Frame Rate

serotonin can modulate perception time, want focus little bit
literature now done fortunately animals humans
essentially shows dopamine released brain,
tend overestimate amount time just passed. Let repeat that.


dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role
molecules

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car
screams blood, or, know, things sort, neural activity gets
repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will
divorce sensation experience somewhat, will divorce
perception experience governed dopamine increase
frame rate. isn't clear, just know this. ice bath, dopamine

Ultradian rhythms rhythms 90 minutes existence
broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. go sleep night, whether
not sleep six hours four hours eight hours 10 hours, entire period
sleep broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. Early night, tend
slow-wave sleep. Later night, tend REM sleep.
nonetheless, sleep broken 90-minute cycles. However,
wake morning, many things governed ultradian

physical work kind work out, 90-minute time block seems
one brain can enter state focus alertness hard work
focus, focus, focus 90 minutes, significant drop ability

focus it, limit 90 minutes less. one people also joined

powerful. One never expect going drop immediately state

00:31:42 Sense Passage Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective

circadian, ultradian rhythms, haven't really talked time perception per

entrained matched year day ultradian cycles can
impose work can leverage toward focus like.
actual perception time? actually controls fast slowly
perceive time going by? basically three forms time perception


aware of. One perception passage time present,
quickly slowly things seem happening us. kind like interval timer
ticking off time. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. either fine-slicing like that, tick, tick,
tick. interval timers. discuss basis interval timers. also
engage called prospective timing like stopwatch measuring off things
go forward. might sound little bit like just described actually
little bit different. instance, told start measuring off two-minute time
interval future, pretty well. told measure
five-minute time interval future couldn't use clocks watches
phone anything like that, set tick marks.
decide many times going count off five-minute time block.
also retrospective time measure off time past. say,
know, last week, know went park, things friends,
know, went evening. long lunch went
dinner friends? probably think, okay, well, remember went dinner
seven lunch right around two. using memory reconstruct certain
sets events past get sense relative positioning within time, okay?
retrospective, current time interval measurements, prospective
time measurement future. beauty time perception human nervous
system boils couple simple molecules govern whether not
fine-slicing time whether not batching time larger bins.
molecules go names maybe heard, things like dopamine
norepinephrine, neuromodulators, called neuromodulators modulate,
change way neural circuits work. Also things like serotonin. Serotonin
released different site brain dopamine epinephrin
different effect time perception. just give example things like
dopamine

00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead Time Overestimation; Frame Rate

serotonin can modulate perception time, want focus little bit
literature now done fortunately animals humans
essentially shows dopamine released brain,
tend overestimate amount time just passed. Let repeat that.


dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,

topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced

attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,

happens circadian clock starts getting disrupted?

00:23:00 Circadian Entrainment Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers

mean, episode time perception. not episode
circadian rhythms entrainment. Well, classic study Aschoff done 1985
now repeated many times people go environments
didn't clocks didn't windows didn't
watches sometimes even constant dark constant light,
evaluated well people perceive passage time shorter timescales
found really interesting. found people underestimate long
isolated environments. 42 days so, ask people
long think here? people say 28 days 36 days.
generally underestimated long odd environment no
clocks watches exposure sunlight regular rhythms artificial light. addition,


found perception shorter time intervals also really disrupted.
ask measure off two minutes, normally people pretty good measuring
off two minutes. People come within, know, 5 15 seconds most. kind
sit just wait, pretty good idea two minutes up.
say two minutes up. Well, people's circadian clocks circadian
entrainment, say, disrupted, perception time measurement
shorter timescales minutes even seconds greatly disrupted. see
couple minutes, actually causes great problems contend work,
contend challenges different kinds. want circadian entrainment
pretty locked pretty entrained outside light-dark cycle

perceive time accurately given task given thing involved turns

00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus

one fundamental ways predicts well poorly perform

cells tissues organs body 365-day journey Earth takes
around sun year talked circadian entrainment, way
24-hour genetic protein clocks every one cells matched
rotation Earth axis exposure lack exposure sun
rotation axis. Next like talk so-called ultradian entrainment.
Ultradian rhythms rhythms 90 minutes existence
broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. go sleep night, whether
not sleep six hours four hours eight hours 10 hours, entire period
sleep broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. Early night, tend
slow-wave sleep. Later night, tend REM sleep.
nonetheless, sleep broken 90-minute cycles. However,
wake morning, many things governed ultradian
rhythms. instance, work, meaning math try learn language
physical work kind work out, 90-minute time block seems
one brain can enter state focus alertness hard work
focus, focus, focus 90 minutes, significant drop ability
engage mental physical work. Now, everybody from, know, self-help


literature business literature pop psychology literature tried leverage
ultradian cycles saying going something hard want
focus it, limit 90 minutes less. one people also joined
conversation indeed use 90-minute work cycles, think extremely
powerful. One never expect going drop immediately state
high focus beginning remain 90 minutes. struggle
varying degrees achieve focus motivation drive within 90-minute
cycles. true, meaning ample literature support idea
90 minutes, tend go state less ability focus. isn't
time perception per se, example entrainment. entraining to,
right? Just can focus 90 minutes not well 100 minutes
120 minutes, entraining to? Well, entraining release
particular neurochemicals, case, acetylcholine dopamine allow brain
focus particular periods time, 90 minutes so, 90 minutes
so, amount chemicals can released tends drop low,
ability focus becomes diminished. one like explore
kind backbone basis ultradian rhythms, goes different name.
originally called basic rest-activity cycle. proposed many years
ago Nathaniel Kleitman. established true within sleep states
mentioned before. debated long time whether not 90-minute
cycles also control ability focus perform work wakeful states turns
do. Now lot literature support that. always get question
know 90 minute cycle begins? words, say wake
8 just finished 90-minute sleep cycle. mean next 90-
minute cycle work begins right 8:01? No, interesting thing
basic rest-activity cycles, ultradian rhythms, can initiate
whenever want. not like circadian rhythm hardwired
unerring signal 24 hours. ultradian rhythms occur sleep hardwired,
unerring. don't get option making sleep cycles 120 minutes five
minutes. don't get option. decide want apply ultradian
rhythms work performance, can set clock decide, okay, now focus
begins. Now work begins 90-minute cycle period going
work. actually this, know, mid morning sometimes twice day,
90-minute cycle limit distraction much possible, put away phone,


often turn off internet well. talked episode kind optimal
workday, least me, just give example might work. want
emphasize ultradian rhythms ones set. decide
going work 90 minutes. can't negotiate, however, 100
minutes 120 minutes, no matter are, going see diminishment
performance. not going focus well. way
90-minute cycles linked ability neurons release acetylcholine
dopamine extent norepinephrine, things give us narrow focus,
motivation, drive, way 90-minute cycles involved circuits.
90 minutes, circuits far less willing engage therefore
much harder continue focus high degree. people like multiple 90-
minute cycles per day focus. case, need separate out. can't
one 90-minute cycle, go right another 90-minute cycle, another 90-
minutes cycle. can't cheat circuits related acetylcholine dopamine
norepinephrine unfortunately. suggest people no three ideally
two just one 90-minute cycles. say ideally? Well,
taxing. narrow tunnel focus. me, can one mid
morning. can probably another one afternoon. not kind work
like checking email text messaging social media. focused hard
work, working hard problems various kinds, will different everybody.
recommend spaced least two four hours people
probably won't able handle two per day. probably
mutants three four, exceedingly rare. think even
one day going feel like significant mental investment, afterwards
going feel pretty taxed. now talked circannual,

00:31:42 Sense Passage Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective

circadian, ultradian rhythms, haven't really talked time perception per
se. mainly talked subconscious slow oscillatory ways
entrained matched year day ultradian cycles can
impose work can leverage toward focus like.
actual perception time? actually controls fast slowly
perceive time going by? basically three forms time perception


aware of. One perception passage time present,
quickly slowly things seem happening us. kind like interval timer
ticking off time. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. either fine-slicing like that, tick, tick,
tick. interval timers. discuss basis interval timers. also
engage called prospective timing like stopwatch measuring off things
go forward. might sound little bit like just described actually
little bit different. instance, told start measuring off two-minute time
interval future, pretty well. told measure
five-minute time interval future couldn't use clocks watches
phone anything like that, set tick marks.
decide many times going count off five-minute time block.
also retrospective time measure off time past. say,
know, last week, know went park, things friends,
know, went evening. long lunch went
dinner friends? probably think, okay, well, remember went dinner
seven lunch right around two. using memory reconstruct certain
sets events past get sense relative positioning within time, okay?
retrospective, current time interval measurements, prospective
time measurement future. beauty time perception human nervous
system boils couple simple molecules govern whether not
fine-slicing time whether not batching time larger bins.
molecules go names maybe heard, things like dopamine
norepinephrine, neuromodulators, called neuromodulators modulate,
change way neural circuits work. Also things like serotonin. Serotonin
released different site brain dopamine epinephrin
different effect time perception. just give example things like
dopamine

00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead Time Overestimation; Frame Rate

serotonin can modulate perception time, want focus little bit
literature now done fortunately animals humans
essentially shows dopamine released brain,
tend overestimate amount time just passed. Let repeat that.


dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role
molecules

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car
screams blood, or, know, things sort, neural activity gets
repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience

therefore perceiving experience differently. One interesting aspect
way neuromodulators like dopamine novelty interact time perception

interesting literature showing novel experiences place,
feel know place, obviously, longer feel there.
kind gedanken thought experiment illustrates literature.
say move New York City. happen really like New York City.

many people three times many novel experiences, actually feel
much longer lived one location. also true
social interactions. move multiple several novel environments

know us much better. Now, course, get opportunity interact
people different contexts indeed get opportunity see them,
instance, coffee shop, order coffee. maybe go sports event,
act there. Maybe interact family. getting sense

happens circadian clock starts getting disrupted?

00:23:00 Circadian Entrainment Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers

mean, episode time perception. not episode
circadian rhythms entrainment. Well, classic study Aschoff done 1985
now repeated many times people go environments
didn't clocks didn't windows didn't
watches sometimes even constant dark constant light,
evaluated well people perceive passage time shorter timescales
found really interesting. found people underestimate long

found perception shorter time intervals also really disrupted.
ask measure off two minutes, normally people pretty good measuring

not sleep six hours four hours eight hours 10 hours, entire period
sleep broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. Early night, tend
slow-wave sleep. Later night, tend REM sleep.
nonetheless, sleep broken 90-minute cycles. However,
wake morning, many things governed ultradian
rhythms. instance, work, meaning math try learn language
physical work kind work out, 90-minute time block seems
one brain can enter state focus alertness hard work
focus, focus, focus 90 minutes, significant drop ability
engage mental physical work. Now, everybody from, know, self-help


literature business literature pop psychology literature tried leverage
ultradian cycles saying going something hard want
focus it, limit 90 minutes less. one people also joined
conversation indeed use 90-minute work cycles, think extremely
powerful. One never expect going drop immediately state
high focus beginning remain 90 minutes. struggle
varying degrees achieve focus motivation drive within 90-minute
cycles. true, meaning ample literature support idea
90 minutes, tend go state less ability focus. isn't
time perception per se, example entrainment. entraining to,
right? Just can focus 90 minutes not well 100 minutes
120 minutes, entraining to? Well, entraining release
particular neurochemicals, case, acetylcholine dopamine allow brain
focus particular periods time, 90 minutes so, 90 minutes
so, amount chemicals can released tends drop low,
ability focus becomes diminished. one like explore
kind backbone basis ultradian rhythms, goes different name.
originally called basic rest-activity cycle. proposed many years
ago Nathaniel Kleitman. established true within sleep states
mentioned before. debated long time whether not 90-minute
cycles also control ability focus perform work wakeful states turns
do. Now lot literature support that. always get question
know 90 minute cycle begins? words, say wake
8 just finished 90-minute sleep cycle. mean next 90-
minute cycle work begins right 8:01? No, interesting thing
basic rest-activity cycles, ultradian rhythms, can initiate
whenever want. not like circadian rhythm hardwired
unerring signal 24 hours. ultradian rhythms occur sleep hardwired,
unerring. don't get option making sleep cycles 120 minutes five
minutes. don't get option. decide want apply ultradian
rhythms work performance, can set clock decide, okay, now focus
begins. Now work begins 90-minute cycle period going
work. actually this, know, mid morning sometimes twice day,
90-minute cycle limit distraction much possible, put away phone,


often turn off internet well. talked episode kind optimal
workday, least me, just give example might work. want
emphasize ultradian rhythms ones set. decide
going work 90 minutes. can't negotiate, however, 100
minutes 120 minutes, no matter are, going see diminishment
performance. not going focus well. way
90-minute cycles linked ability neurons release acetylcholine
dopamine extent norepinephrine, things give us narrow focus,
motivation, drive, way 90-minute cycles involved circuits.
90 minutes, circuits far less willing engage therefore
much harder continue focus high degree. people like multiple 90-
minute cycles per day focus. case, need separate out. can't
one 90-minute cycle, go right another 90-minute cycle, another 90-
minutes cycle. can't cheat circuits related acetylcholine dopamine
norepinephrine unfortunately. suggest people no three ideally
two just one 90-minute cycles. say ideally? Well,
taxing. narrow tunnel focus. me, can one mid
morning. can probably another one afternoon. not kind work
like checking email text messaging social media. focused hard
work, working hard problems various kinds, will different everybody.
recommend spaced least two four hours people
probably won't able handle two per day. probably
mutants three four, exceedingly rare. think even
one day going feel like significant mental investment, afterwards
going feel pretty taxed. now talked circannual,

00:31:42 Sense Passage Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective

circadian, ultradian rhythms, haven't really talked time perception per
se. mainly talked subconscious slow oscillatory ways
entrained matched year day ultradian cycles can
impose work can leverage toward focus like.
actual perception time? actually controls fast slowly
perceive time going by? basically three forms time perception


aware of. One perception passage time present,
quickly slowly things seem happening us. kind like interval timer
ticking off time. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. either fine-slicing like that, tick, tick,
tick. interval timers. discuss basis interval timers. also
engage called prospective timing like stopwatch measuring off things
go forward. might sound little bit like just described actually
little bit different. instance, told start measuring off two-minute time
interval future, pretty well. told measure
five-minute time interval future couldn't use clocks watches
phone anything like that, set tick marks.
decide many times going count off five-minute time block.
also retrospective time measure off time past. say,
know, last week, know went park, things friends,
know, went evening. long lunch went
dinner friends? probably think, okay, well, remember went dinner
seven lunch right around two. using memory reconstruct certain
sets events past get sense relative positioning within time, okay?
retrospective, current time interval measurements, prospective
time measurement future. beauty time perception human nervous
system boils couple simple molecules govern whether not
fine-slicing time whether not batching time larger bins.
molecules go names maybe heard, things like dopamine
norepinephrine, neuromodulators, called neuromodulators modulate,
change way neural circuits work. Also things like serotonin. Serotonin
released different site brain dopamine epinephrin
different effect time perception. just give example things like
dopamine

00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead Time Overestimation; Frame Rate

serotonin can modulate perception time, want focus little bit
literature now done fortunately animals humans
essentially shows dopamine released brain,
tend overestimate amount time just passed. Let repeat that.


dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role
molecules

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car
screams blood, or, know, things sort, neural activity gets
repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will
divorce sensation experience somewhat, will divorce
perception experience governed dopamine increase
frame rate. isn't clear, just know this. ice bath, dopamine

day waiting waiting room dentist, pretty boring.
just kind sitting there. wasn't much going on. seem like going
awfully long time, indeed, looking back, just seems like, okay, sat
room, not much happened. seems like short time bin. seems
efficiency brain stores information, dopamine associated, course,
fun varied experiences low dopamine associated kind empty,
boring, time seem like long experiences. whole thing
stamped scientific literature earlier experiments take
human beings isolate certain environments. know, take away
clocks watches cues time day time night
allow people life can either read work things
little do. people isolated boring environments
don't access time cues, time dilates. tend assume time
gone very, long. reason bring aren't just driven
circadian clocks circannual clocks ultradian clocks.
driven timers vary depending level excitement vary
depending level excitement neuromodulators, dopamine

stopwatches. One dopaminergic stopwatch fine-slices really closely. like,
counts off milliseconds grabbing movie experience high

therefore perceiving experience differently. One interesting aspect
way neuromodulators like dopamine novelty interact time perception
memory perceive relationship places people. really
interesting literature showing novel experiences place,
feel know place, obviously, longer feel there.
kind gedanken thought experiment illustrates literature.
say move New York City. happen really like New York City.
never lived there, say lived there. lived given apartment year

year. however lived three different places New York City met three times
many people three times many novel experiences, actually feel
much longer lived one location. also true
social interactions. move multiple several novel environments
somebody else, tend feel know person much better
know us much better. Now, course, get opportunity interact
people different contexts indeed get opportunity see them,
instance, coffee shop, order coffee. maybe go sports event,
act there. Maybe interact family. getting sense
different contexts. certainly playing role, seems
novelty experience somebody, not familiar you,
time feel spent them, even though total amount time can

cool. brain imaging individuals watching basketball games.
basketball games actually took place recorded subjects
watching basketball games cases, not all, interest

interesting study not just dopamine released time
something subject wanted see happened, right, time wanted see
team score, scored, also surprise. thought instance,
hit button predict team going score particular
drive didn't, well, dopamine also released response
surprise. speaks dopamine something important not just
positive events, unexpected events. Now, interesting speaks
fact dopamine kind flexible currency brain. doled out, will,
released something one hopes will happen happens released
surprise, even kind negative surprise. not something

00:21:13 Tool 4: Timing Physical Activity; Tool 5: Timing Eating Window



number different reasons. ways so-called entrain
circadian clock. One best ways engage physical activity fairly
regular times day. don't every day going exercise, try
exercise fairly consistent time day. Probably better exercise not
exercise, even move time day, light activity and, talk
third minute, food, major ways entrain internal perception
time external events world, meaning turning Earth
therefore exposure sunlight not. addition sunlight viewing
morning throughout day avoiding bright light night kind, not just
blue light, trying get activity, exercise fairly regular, within plus minus
two hours, day next going positive effect so-called
circadian entrainment, also eating fairly regular times. However, exciting.
data mainly point fact need eat within less time
window day, not always need eat meals exactly time.
don't necessarily eat lunch noon snack four dinner
eight order keep circadian entrainment aligned sharp.
instance small snack noon eat two dinner six
small snack eight. doesn't much matter exact meals fall much
fall less within consistent period phase 24-hour cycle.
happens circadian clock starts getting disrupted?

00:23:00 Circadian Entrainment Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers

mean, episode time perception. not episode
circadian rhythms entrainment. Well, classic study Aschoff done 1985
now repeated many times people go environments
didn't clocks didn't windows didn't
watches sometimes even constant dark constant light,
evaluated well people perceive passage time shorter timescales
found really interesting. found people underestimate long
isolated environments. 42 days so, ask people
long think here? people say 28 days 36 days.
generally underestimated long odd environment no
clocks watches exposure sunlight regular rhythms artificial light. addition,


found perception shorter time intervals also really disrupted.
ask measure off two minutes, normally people pretty good measuring
off two minutes. People come within, know, 5 15 seconds most. kind
sit just wait, pretty good idea two minutes up.
say two minutes up. Well, people's circadian clocks circadian
entrainment, say, disrupted, perception time measurement
shorter timescales minutes even seconds greatly disrupted. see
couple minutes, actually causes great problems contend work,
contend challenges different kinds. want circadian entrainment
pretty locked pretty entrained outside light-dark cycle
perception time shorter time intervals can precise ability
perceive time accurately given task given thing involved turns

00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus

one fundamental ways predicts well poorly perform
thing task. talked circannual entrainment, matching
cells tissues organs body 365-day journey Earth takes
around sun year talked circadian entrainment, way
24-hour genetic protein clocks every one cells matched
rotation Earth axis exposure lack exposure sun
rotation axis. Next like talk so-called ultradian entrainment.
Ultradian rhythms rhythms 90 minutes existence
broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. go sleep night, whether
not sleep six hours four hours eight hours 10 hours, entire period
sleep broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. Early night, tend
slow-wave sleep. Later night, tend REM sleep.
nonetheless, sleep broken 90-minute cycles. However,
wake morning, many things governed ultradian
rhythms. instance, work, meaning math try learn language
physical work kind work out, 90-minute time block seems
one brain can enter state focus alertness hard work
focus, focus, focus 90 minutes, significant drop ability
engage mental physical work. Now, everybody from, know, self-help


literature business literature pop psychology literature tried leverage
ultradian cycles saying going something hard want
focus it, limit 90 minutes less. one people also joined
conversation indeed use 90-minute work cycles, think extremely
powerful. One never expect going drop immediately state
high focus beginning remain 90 minutes. struggle
varying degrees achieve focus motivation drive within 90-minute
cycles. true, meaning ample literature support idea
90 minutes, tend go state less ability focus. isn't
time perception per se, example entrainment. entraining to,
right? Just can focus 90 minutes not well 100 minutes
120 minutes, entraining to? Well, entraining release
particular neurochemicals, case, acetylcholine dopamine allow brain
focus particular periods time, 90 minutes so, 90 minutes
so, amount chemicals can released tends drop low,
ability focus becomes diminished. one like explore
kind backbone basis ultradian rhythms, goes different name.
originally called basic rest-activity cycle. proposed many years
ago Nathaniel Kleitman. established true within sleep states
mentioned before. debated long time whether not 90-minute
cycles also control ability focus perform work wakeful states turns
do. Now lot literature support that. always get question
know 90 minute cycle begins? words, say wake
8 just finished 90-minute sleep cycle. mean next 90-
minute cycle work begins right 8:01? No, interesting thing
basic rest-activity cycles, ultradian rhythms, can initiate
whenever want. not like circadian rhythm hardwired
unerring signal 24 hours. ultradian rhythms occur sleep hardwired,
unerring. don't get option making sleep cycles 120 minutes five
minutes. don't get option. decide want apply ultradian
rhythms work performance, can set clock decide, okay, now focus
begins. Now work begins 90-minute cycle period going
work. actually this, know, mid morning sometimes twice day,
90-minute cycle limit distraction much possible, put away phone,


often turn off internet well. talked episode kind optimal
workday, least me, just give example might work. want
emphasize ultradian rhythms ones set. decide
going work 90 minutes. can't negotiate, however, 100
minutes 120 minutes, no matter are, going see diminishment
performance. not going focus well. way
90-minute cycles linked ability neurons release acetylcholine
dopamine extent norepinephrine, things give us narrow focus,
motivation, drive, way 90-minute cycles involved circuits.
90 minutes, circuits far less willing engage therefore
much harder continue focus high degree. people like multiple 90-
minute cycles per day focus. case, need separate out. can't
one 90-minute cycle, go right another 90-minute cycle, another 90-
minutes cycle. can't cheat circuits related acetylcholine dopamine
norepinephrine unfortunately. suggest people no three ideally
two just one 90-minute cycles. say ideally? Well,
taxing. narrow tunnel focus. me, can one mid
morning. can probably another one afternoon. not kind work
like checking email text messaging social media. focused hard
work, working hard problems various kinds, will different everybody.
recommend spaced least two four hours people
probably won't able handle two per day. probably
mutants three four, exceedingly rare. think even
one day going feel like significant mental investment, afterwards
going feel pretty taxed. now talked circannual,

00:31:42 Sense Passage Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective

circadian, ultradian rhythms, haven't really talked time perception per
se. mainly talked subconscious slow oscillatory ways
entrained matched year day ultradian cycles can
impose work can leverage toward focus like.
actual perception time? actually controls fast slowly
perceive time going by? basically three forms time perception


aware of. One perception passage time present,
quickly slowly things seem happening us. kind like interval timer
ticking off time. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. either fine-slicing like that, tick, tick,
tick. interval timers. discuss basis interval timers. also
engage called prospective timing like stopwatch measuring off things
go forward. might sound little bit like just described actually
little bit different. instance, told start measuring off two-minute time
interval future, pretty well. told measure
five-minute time interval future couldn't use clocks watches
phone anything like that, set tick marks.
decide many times going count off five-minute time block.
also retrospective time measure off time past. say,
know, last week, know went park, things friends,
know, went evening. long lunch went
dinner friends? probably think, okay, well, remember went dinner
seven lunch right around two. using memory reconstruct certain
sets events past get sense relative positioning within time, okay?
retrospective, current time interval measurements, prospective
time measurement future. beauty time perception human nervous
system boils couple simple molecules govern whether not
fine-slicing time whether not batching time larger bins.
molecules go names maybe heard, things like dopamine
norepinephrine, neuromodulators, called neuromodulators modulate,
change way neural circuits work. Also things like serotonin. Serotonin
released different site brain dopamine epinephrin
different effect time perception. just give example things like
dopamine

00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead Time Overestimation; Frame Rate

serotonin can modulate perception time, want focus little bit
literature now done fortunately animals humans
essentially shows dopamine released brain,
tend overestimate amount time just passed. Let repeat that.


dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role
molecules

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car
screams blood, or, know, things sort, neural activity gets
repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will
divorce sensation experience somewhat, will divorce
perception experience governed dopamine increase

efficiency brain stores information, dopamine associated, course,
fun varied experiences low dopamine associated kind empty,
boring, time seem like long experiences. whole thing
stamped scientific literature earlier experiments take
human beings isolate certain environments. know, take away

therefore perceiving experience differently. One interesting aspect
way neuromodulators like dopamine novelty interact time perception
memory perceive relationship places people. really
interesting literature showing novel experiences place,
feel know place, obviously, longer feel there.
kind gedanken thought experiment illustrates literature.
say move New York City. happen really like New York City.
never lived there, say lived there. lived given apartment year
number different experiences mental experiment. say
100 different exciting new experiences. end year feel

year. however lived three different places New York City met three times
many people three times many novel experiences, actually feel
much longer lived one location. also true
social interactions. move multiple several novel environments
somebody else, tend feel know person much better
know us much better. Now, course, get opportunity interact
people different contexts indeed get opportunity see them,
instance, coffee shop, order coffee. maybe go sports event,
act there. Maybe interact family. getting sense
different contexts. certainly playing role, seems
novelty experience somebody, not familiar you,
time feel spent them, even though total amount time can

talked lot different neurochemicals neurochemicals can
influence perception time. haven't talked lot neural circuits
various areas brain underlie this. want touch highlighting


really wonderful study. study published "Neuron," also Cell Press journal,
excellent journal. title paper "Behavioral, Physiological, Neural

cool. brain imaging individuals watching basketball games.
basketball games actually took place recorded subjects
watching basketball games cases, not all, interest

dopamine released. two brain areas light functional imaging so-called
FSRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging used study. really
interesting study not just dopamine released time
something subject wanted see happened, right, time wanted see
team score, scored, also surprise. thought instance,
hit button predict team going score particular
drive didn't, well, dopamine also released response
surprise. speaks dopamine something important not just
positive events, unexpected events. Now, interesting speaks
fact dopamine kind flexible currency brain. doled out, will,
released something one hopes will happen happens released
surprise, even kind negative surprise. not something
subject wanted happen. interesting thing relates time

many people talked habits. People discussed habits
variety contexts context dopamine reward time perception,
means placing specific habitual routines particular intervals throughout

look like? mean waking one specific habit
always engage causes release dopamine. can say, well, great.
That'll make feel good. agree. Dopamine released generally makes us
feel motivated additional effect marking time day

clock genes clock genes regulate number different functions.
every cell body 24-hour cycle gene protein expression Earth
rotates every 24 hours processes happening every cell
body linked. entrained, say, outside light-dark cycle
morning sunlight, evening sunlight, lack light middle night make
sure changes, oscillations occurring within cells brain
body matched outside light-dark cycle. Don't want go details
happens simple tools one can use ensure
entrainment, circadian entrainment, precise. cannot emphasize
enough important circadian entrainment precise, why?
disruptions circadian entrainment cause huge health problems. increase cancer
risk. increase obesity. increase mental health issues. decrease wound
healing. decrease physical mental performance. disrupt hormones.
want cells linked circadian cycle outside circadian
cycle outside mainly consists sunlight not.
simple protocols fall whole discussion circadian
entrainment following. View 10 30 minutes bright light, ideally sunlight,
within hour waking assuming waking early day especially.
wake early day, get outside, see sunlight. afternoon
around evening, 10 30 minutes, depending bright outside. Artificial lights
throughout day, want awake wake early no
sunlight outside, can course turn artificial lights want awake
basically want much bright light, ideally sunlight, coming
eyes throughout day. evening, want little bright light coming
eyes. said podcast.
always lot negotiations, want make things clear. Try not wear
sunglasses can safely. Fine wear eye glasses contacts. not going
problem. light viewing avoidance light night set
fundamental layer time perception. One best ways disrupt
perception time ways going talk subsequent portions
podcast disrupt circadian clock not good thing

00:21:13 Tool 4: Timing Physical Activity; Tool 5: Timing Eating Window



number different reasons. ways so-called entrain
circadian clock. One best ways engage physical activity fairly
regular times day. don't every day going exercise, try
exercise fairly consistent time day. Probably better exercise not
exercise, even move time day, light activity and, talk
third minute, food, major ways entrain internal perception
time external events world, meaning turning Earth
therefore exposure sunlight not. addition sunlight viewing
morning throughout day avoiding bright light night kind, not just
blue light, trying get activity, exercise fairly regular, within plus minus
two hours, day next going positive effect so-called
circadian entrainment, also eating fairly regular times. However, exciting.
data mainly point fact need eat within less time
window day, not always need eat meals exactly time.
don't necessarily eat lunch noon snack four dinner
eight order keep circadian entrainment aligned sharp.
instance small snack noon eat two dinner six
small snack eight. doesn't much matter exact meals fall much
fall less within consistent period phase 24-hour cycle.
happens circadian clock starts getting disrupted?

00:23:00 Circadian Entrainment Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers

mean, episode time perception. not episode
circadian rhythms entrainment. Well, classic study Aschoff done 1985
now repeated many times people go environments
didn't clocks didn't windows didn't
watches sometimes even constant dark constant light,
evaluated well people perceive passage time shorter timescales
found really interesting. found people underestimate long
isolated environments. 42 days so, ask people
long think here? people say 28 days 36 days.
generally underestimated long odd environment no
clocks watches exposure sunlight regular rhythms artificial light. addition,


found perception shorter time intervals also really disrupted.
ask measure off two minutes, normally people pretty good measuring
off two minutes. People come within, know, 5 15 seconds most. kind
sit just wait, pretty good idea two minutes up.
say two minutes up. Well, people's circadian clocks circadian
entrainment, say, disrupted, perception time measurement
shorter timescales minutes even seconds greatly disrupted. see
couple minutes, actually causes great problems contend work,
contend challenges different kinds. want circadian entrainment
pretty locked pretty entrained outside light-dark cycle
perception time shorter time intervals can precise ability
perceive time accurately given task given thing involved turns

00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus

one fundamental ways predicts well poorly perform
thing task. talked circannual entrainment, matching
cells tissues organs body 365-day journey Earth takes
around sun year talked circadian entrainment, way
24-hour genetic protein clocks every one cells matched
rotation Earth axis exposure lack exposure sun
rotation axis. Next like talk so-called ultradian entrainment.
Ultradian rhythms rhythms 90 minutes existence
broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. go sleep night, whether
not sleep six hours four hours eight hours 10 hours, entire period
sleep broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. Early night, tend
slow-wave sleep. Later night, tend REM sleep.
nonetheless, sleep broken 90-minute cycles. However,
wake morning, many things governed ultradian
rhythms. instance, work, meaning math try learn language
physical work kind work out, 90-minute time block seems
one brain can enter state focus alertness hard work
focus, focus, focus 90 minutes, significant drop ability
engage mental physical work. Now, everybody from, know, self-help


literature business literature pop psychology literature tried leverage
ultradian cycles saying going something hard want
focus it, limit 90 minutes less. one people also joined
conversation indeed use 90-minute work cycles, think extremely
powerful. One never expect going drop immediately state
high focus beginning remain 90 minutes. struggle
varying degrees achieve focus motivation drive within 90-minute
cycles. true, meaning ample literature support idea
90 minutes, tend go state less ability focus. isn't
time perception per se, example entrainment. entraining to,
right? Just can focus 90 minutes not well 100 minutes
120 minutes, entraining to? Well, entraining release
particular neurochemicals, case, acetylcholine dopamine allow brain
focus particular periods time, 90 minutes so, 90 minutes
so, amount chemicals can released tends drop low,
ability focus becomes diminished. one like explore
kind backbone basis ultradian rhythms, goes different name.
originally called basic rest-activity cycle. proposed many years
ago Nathaniel Kleitman. established true within sleep states
mentioned before. debated long time whether not 90-minute
cycles also control ability focus perform work wakeful states turns
do. Now lot literature support that. always get question
know 90 minute cycle begins? words, say wake
8 just finished 90-minute sleep cycle. mean next 90-
minute cycle work begins right 8:01? No, interesting thing
basic rest-activity cycles, ultradian rhythms, can initiate
whenever want. not like circadian rhythm hardwired
unerring signal 24 hours. ultradian rhythms occur sleep hardwired,
unerring. don't get option making sleep cycles 120 minutes five
minutes. don't get option. decide want apply ultradian
rhythms work performance, can set clock decide, okay, now focus
begins. Now work begins 90-minute cycle period going
work. actually this, know, mid morning sometimes twice day,
90-minute cycle limit distraction much possible, put away phone,


often turn off internet well. talked episode kind optimal
workday, least me, just give example might work. want
emphasize ultradian rhythms ones set. decide
going work 90 minutes. can't negotiate, however, 100
minutes 120 minutes, no matter are, going see diminishment
performance. not going focus well. way
90-minute cycles linked ability neurons release acetylcholine
dopamine extent norepinephrine, things give us narrow focus,
motivation, drive, way 90-minute cycles involved circuits.
90 minutes, circuits far less willing engage therefore
much harder continue focus high degree. people like multiple 90-
minute cycles per day focus. case, need separate out. can't
one 90-minute cycle, go right another 90-minute cycle, another 90-
minutes cycle. can't cheat circuits related acetylcholine dopamine
norepinephrine unfortunately. suggest people no three ideally
two just one 90-minute cycles. say ideally? Well,
taxing. narrow tunnel focus. me, can one mid
morning. can probably another one afternoon. not kind work
like checking email text messaging social media. focused hard
work, working hard problems various kinds, will different everybody.
recommend spaced least two four hours people
probably won't able handle two per day. probably
mutants three four, exceedingly rare. think even
one day going feel like significant mental investment, afterwards
going feel pretty taxed. now talked circannual,

00:31:42 Sense Passage Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective

circadian, ultradian rhythms, haven't really talked time perception per
se. mainly talked subconscious slow oscillatory ways
entrained matched year day ultradian cycles can
impose work can leverage toward focus like.
actual perception time? actually controls fast slowly
perceive time going by? basically three forms time perception


aware of. One perception passage time present,
quickly slowly things seem happening us. kind like interval timer
ticking off time. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. either fine-slicing like that, tick, tick,
tick. interval timers. discuss basis interval timers. also
engage called prospective timing like stopwatch measuring off things
go forward. might sound little bit like just described actually
little bit different. instance, told start measuring off two-minute time
interval future, pretty well. told measure
five-minute time interval future couldn't use clocks watches
phone anything like that, set tick marks.
decide many times going count off five-minute time block.
also retrospective time measure off time past. say,
know, last week, know went park, things friends,
know, went evening. long lunch went
dinner friends? probably think, okay, well, remember went dinner
seven lunch right around two. using memory reconstruct certain
sets events past get sense relative positioning within time, okay?
retrospective, current time interval measurements, prospective
time measurement future. beauty time perception human nervous
system boils couple simple molecules govern whether not
fine-slicing time whether not batching time larger bins.
molecules go names maybe heard, things like dopamine
norepinephrine, neuromodulators, called neuromodulators modulate,
change way neural circuits work. Also things like serotonin. Serotonin
released different site brain dopamine epinephrin
different effect time perception. just give example things like
dopamine

00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead Time Overestimation; Frame Rate

serotonin can modulate perception time, want focus little bit
literature now done fortunately animals humans
essentially shows dopamine released brain,
tend overestimate amount time just passed. Let repeat that.


dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role
molecules

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car
screams blood, or, know, things sort, neural activity gets
repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will
divorce sensation experience somewhat, will divorce
perception experience governed dopamine increase
frame rate. isn't clear, just know this. ice bath, dopamine
levels high. dopamine levels high, experience discomfort

00:56:30 Fun “Feels Fast” Remembered Slow; Boring Stuff “Feels Slow,”

ice bath higher resolution. Now, now, talking
dopamine, extent, serotonin can differentially impact perception
fast slowly things happening moment. remember,
prospective time, experience time moment,
retrospective time beautiful studies showed
dopaminergic state changes way not just experience things now,
changes way remember things past rate
things occurred. opposite direction. make simple,
something experience fun varied, meaning lot different

brain, will experience going fast. Now, different
ice bath just said experienced going slowly, talking
something fun varied really like feel like goes
very, fast. Imagine amazing day kid amusement park. can
ton things. new. excited feel like goes fast,
later will remember experience long, long day full
many, many events. paradoxical relationship
perceive fun, exciting, varied events present remember
past. who've gone vacation, amazing day
vacation, it'll seem like, amazing vacation overall, will seem like goes


fast. last day vacation, sort go, whoa, went fast 'cause
much happening. memory six eight months later, remember, wow, just
went, know, long, long thing. this. that.
this. that. tends spool longer memory actual

don't like, going seem like takes long time go experience
moment, retroactively, looking back, will seem like moment short.
day waiting waiting room dentist, pretty boring.
just kind sitting there. wasn't much going on. seem like going
awfully long time, indeed, looking back, just seems like, okay, sat
room, not much happened. seems like short time bin. seems
efficiency brain stores information, dopamine associated, course,
fun varied experiences low dopamine associated kind empty,
boring, time seem like long experiences. whole thing
stamped scientific literature earlier experiments take
human beings isolate certain environments. know, take away
clocks watches cues time day time night
allow people life can either read work things
little do. people isolated boring environments
don't access time cues, time dilates. tend assume time
gone very, long. reason bring aren't just driven
circadian clocks circannual clocks ultradian clocks.
driven timers vary depending level excitement vary
depending level excitement neuromodulators, dopamine
serotonin. way like think two clocks, two
stopwatches. One dopaminergic stopwatch fine-slices really closely. like,
counts off milliseconds grabbing movie experience high
resolution. hand, stopwatch gathering big time bins,
big ticks along the, know, hand moving bigger intervals, know, marking
off time. depending whether not excited whether not bored,
using different stopwatches time

01:00:54 Retrospective Time, Context Variation & Enhanced Bonding Places &

therefore perceiving experience differently. One interesting aspect
way neuromodulators like dopamine novelty interact time perception
memory perceive relationship places people. really
interesting literature showing novel experiences place,
feel know place, obviously, longer feel there.
kind gedanken thought experiment illustrates literature.
say move New York City. happen really like New York City.
never lived there, say lived there. lived given apartment year
number different experiences mental experiment. say
100 different exciting new experiences. end year feel
lived certain period time, one year. actually know lived one
year. however lived three different places New York City met three times
many people three times many novel experiences, actually feel
much longer lived one location. also true
social interactions. move multiple several novel environments
somebody else, tend feel know person much better
know us much better. Now, course, get opportunity interact
people different contexts indeed get opportunity see them,
instance, coffee shop, order coffee. maybe go sports event,
act there. Maybe interact family. getting sense
different contexts. certainly playing role, seems
novelty experience somebody, not familiar you,
time feel spent them, even though total amount time can
exactly same. interesting aspect perception
time neuromodulators novelty can shape way not just
perceive

01:03:00 Dopamine Release Resets Start Time Bin Experience

given event world, relate place relate person.
talked lot different neurochemicals neurochemicals can
influence perception time. haven't talked lot neural circuits
various areas brain underlie this. want touch highlighting


really wonderful study. study published "Neuron," also Cell Press journal,
excellent journal. title paper "Behavioral, Physiological, Neural
Signatures Surprise Naturalistic Sports Viewing." experiment really
cool. brain imaging individuals watching basketball games.
basketball games actually took place recorded subjects
watching basketball games cases, not all, interest
win lose, cases, not all, subjects studies prior
knowledge team thought better, team likely win not
likely win. basic findings study measure surprise
release dopamine two areas brain, part called, called,
excuse me, mesolimbic reward pathway. two areas brain
important nucleus accumbens VTA, ventral tegmental area.
areas release dopamine kind token reward time something
surprising positive expectation met, okay? predict team dribbling
court going score drive get ball basket, little bit
dopamine released. two brain areas light functional imaging so-called
FSRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging used study. really
interesting study not just dopamine released time
something subject wanted see happened, right, time wanted see
team score, scored, also surprise. thought instance,
hit button predict team going score particular
drive didn't, well, dopamine also released response
surprise. speaks dopamine something important not just
positive events, unexpected events. Now, interesting speaks
fact dopamine kind flexible currency brain. doled out, will,
released something one hopes will happen happens released
surprise, even kind negative surprise. not something
subject wanted happen. interesting thing relates time
perception. found regardless caused dopamine release,
frequency dopamine release predicted subjects parsed time bins
game watching. mean that? Well, watch basketball
game watch anything, children playing talking spouse whatever,
batching time. batching time? Well, batch meal the,
don't know, appetizer, main course, dessert, turns not


doing. batching time according frequency dopamine pulses,
frequency dopamine release. saw study.
evaluated people's perceptions passage time, found
matched not whether not the, know, particular time point game, not
whether not team going court running back court play
defense, dopamine released served markers predict frame
rate perception experience. sounds complicated, mean
often release dopamine actually setting frame rate
entire perception everything, not just positive events negative events.
means going life, dopamine release dopamine
saying now new phase life even short, right?
get morning really need cup coffee, probably know,
wait 90 minutes 120 minutes drink coffee, get coffee
surely dopamine hit there, promise you, actually starting carve
day according dopamine hits. Consciously subconsciously,

01:07:40 Habits & Time Perception; Tool 10 (Setting Functional Units Day)

actually carving experience according getting dopamine
throughout day. governance perception time dopamine
points clear, actionable, powerful tool. tool
many people talked habits. People discussed habits
variety contexts context dopamine reward time perception,
means placing specific habitual routines particular intervals throughout
day very, not just convenient, good way incorporate dopamine
system divide day series call functional units.
look like? mean waking one specific habit
always engage causes release dopamine. can say, well, great.
That'll make feel good. agree. Dopamine released generally makes us
feel motivated additional effect marking time day
beginning particular time bin. inserting another habit, perhaps beginning
of, don't know, breakfast something, recognizing habit
fairly habitual, don't be, know, obsessively precise
timing, regular sequencing things going lead not just dopamine release


relates reward motivation feeling good, actually becomes way
carve entire experience day. almost circular
argument. say, well, course, know, one thing, next,
next, perceive day. day. list.
to-do list, et cetera. saying basis study,
mention first author, last name Antony. Antony et al. published
2020. study basketball viewing, points engaging specific
habits know can perform well, actually setting frame rate
day. think will soon come time human beings not just thinking
of, okay, morning routine afternoon routine, think can useful,
fact, used mentioned structure sort earlier episode, rather thinking
actually going level biology, dopamine
marking time. Habits clear way can invoke dopamine release
therefore provide time markers, means that, instance,
morning, might insert habit one habit two at, say, don't know, 8 10 AM,
that, marks epoch, little batch time morning routine
distinct second half morning. words, habits serve
flankers markers passage day. Now, seems kind hyper-
neurotic want structure life like that, say many people

number different reasons. ways so-called entrain
circadian clock. One best ways engage physical activity fairly
regular times day. don't every day going exercise, try
exercise fairly consistent time day. Probably better exercise not
exercise, even move time day, light activity and, talk
third minute, food, major ways entrain internal perception
time external events world, meaning turning Earth
therefore exposure sunlight not. addition sunlight viewing
morning throughout day avoiding bright light night kind, not just
blue light, trying get activity, exercise fairly regular, within plus minus
two hours, day next going positive effect so-called
circadian entrainment, also eating fairly regular times. However, exciting.
data mainly point fact need eat within less time
window day, not always need eat meals exactly time.
don't necessarily eat lunch noon snack four dinner
eight order keep circadian entrainment aligned sharp.
instance small snack noon eat two dinner six
small snack eight. doesn't much matter exact meals fall much
fall less within consistent period phase 24-hour cycle.
happens circadian clock starts getting disrupted?

00:23:00 Circadian Entrainment Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers

mean, episode time perception. not episode
circadian rhythms entrainment. Well, classic study Aschoff done 1985
now repeated many times people go environments
didn't clocks didn't windows didn't
watches sometimes even constant dark constant light,
evaluated well people perceive passage time shorter timescales
found really interesting. found people underestimate long
isolated environments. 42 days so, ask people
long think here? people say 28 days 36 days.
generally underestimated long odd environment no
clocks watches exposure sunlight regular rhythms artificial light. addition,


found perception shorter time intervals also really disrupted.
ask measure off two minutes, normally people pretty good measuring
off two minutes. People come within, know, 5 15 seconds most. kind
sit just wait, pretty good idea two minutes up.
say two minutes up. Well, people's circadian clocks circadian
entrainment, say, disrupted, perception time measurement
shorter timescales minutes even seconds greatly disrupted. see
couple minutes, actually causes great problems contend work,
contend challenges different kinds. want circadian entrainment
pretty locked pretty entrained outside light-dark cycle
perception time shorter time intervals can precise ability
perceive time accurately given task given thing involved turns

00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus

one fundamental ways predicts well poorly perform
thing task. talked circannual entrainment, matching
cells tissues organs body 365-day journey Earth takes
around sun year talked circadian entrainment, way
24-hour genetic protein clocks every one cells matched
rotation Earth axis exposure lack exposure sun
rotation axis. Next like talk so-called ultradian entrainment.
Ultradian rhythms rhythms 90 minutes existence
broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. go sleep night, whether
not sleep six hours four hours eight hours 10 hours, entire period
sleep broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. Early night, tend
slow-wave sleep. Later night, tend REM sleep.
nonetheless, sleep broken 90-minute cycles. However,
wake morning, many things governed ultradian
rhythms. instance, work, meaning math try learn language
physical work kind work out, 90-minute time block seems
one brain can enter state focus alertness hard work
focus, focus, focus 90 minutes, significant drop ability
engage mental physical work. Now, everybody from, know, self-help


literature business literature pop psychology literature tried leverage
ultradian cycles saying going something hard want
focus it, limit 90 minutes less. one people also joined
conversation indeed use 90-minute work cycles, think extremely
powerful. One never expect going drop immediately state
high focus beginning remain 90 minutes. struggle
varying degrees achieve focus motivation drive within 90-minute
cycles. true, meaning ample literature support idea
90 minutes, tend go state less ability focus. isn't
time perception per se, example entrainment. entraining to,
right? Just can focus 90 minutes not well 100 minutes
120 minutes, entraining to? Well, entraining release
particular neurochemicals, case, acetylcholine dopamine allow brain
focus particular periods time, 90 minutes so, 90 minutes
so, amount chemicals can released tends drop low,
ability focus becomes diminished. one like explore
kind backbone basis ultradian rhythms, goes different name.
originally called basic rest-activity cycle. proposed many years
ago Nathaniel Kleitman. established true within sleep states
mentioned before. debated long time whether not 90-minute
cycles also control ability focus perform work wakeful states turns
do. Now lot literature support that. always get question
know 90 minute cycle begins? words, say wake
8 just finished 90-minute sleep cycle. mean next 90-
minute cycle work begins right 8:01? No, interesting thing
basic rest-activity cycles, ultradian rhythms, can initiate
whenever want. not like circadian rhythm hardwired
unerring signal 24 hours. ultradian rhythms occur sleep hardwired,
unerring. don't get option making sleep cycles 120 minutes five
minutes. don't get option. decide want apply ultradian
rhythms work performance, can set clock decide, okay, now focus
begins. Now work begins 90-minute cycle period going
work. actually this, know, mid morning sometimes twice day,
90-minute cycle limit distraction much possible, put away phone,


often turn off internet well. talked episode kind optimal
workday, least me, just give example might work. want
emphasize ultradian rhythms ones set. decide
going work 90 minutes. can't negotiate, however, 100
minutes 120 minutes, no matter are, going see diminishment
performance. not going focus well. way
90-minute cycles linked ability neurons release acetylcholine
dopamine extent norepinephrine, things give us narrow focus,
motivation, drive, way 90-minute cycles involved circuits.
90 minutes, circuits far less willing engage therefore
much harder continue focus high degree. people like multiple 90-
minute cycles per day focus. case, need separate out. can't
one 90-minute cycle, go right another 90-minute cycle, another 90-
minutes cycle. can't cheat circuits related acetylcholine dopamine
norepinephrine unfortunately. suggest people no three ideally
two just one 90-minute cycles. say ideally? Well,
taxing. narrow tunnel focus. me, can one mid
morning. can probably another one afternoon. not kind work
like checking email text messaging social media. focused hard
work, working hard problems various kinds, will different everybody.
recommend spaced least two four hours people
probably won't able handle two per day. probably
mutants three four, exceedingly rare. think even
one day going feel like significant mental investment, afterwards
going feel pretty taxed. now talked circannual,

00:31:42 Sense Passage Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective

circadian, ultradian rhythms, haven't really talked time perception per
se. mainly talked subconscious slow oscillatory ways
entrained matched year day ultradian cycles can
impose work can leverage toward focus like.
actual perception time? actually controls fast slowly
perceive time going by? basically three forms time perception


aware of. One perception passage time present,
quickly slowly things seem happening us. kind like interval timer
ticking off time. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. either fine-slicing like that, tick, tick,
tick. interval timers. discuss basis interval timers. also
engage called prospective timing like stopwatch measuring off things
go forward. might sound little bit like just described actually
little bit different. instance, told start measuring off two-minute time
interval future, pretty well. told measure
five-minute time interval future couldn't use clocks watches
phone anything like that, set tick marks.
decide many times going count off five-minute time block.
also retrospective time measure off time past. say,
know, last week, know went park, things friends,
know, went evening. long lunch went
dinner friends? probably think, okay, well, remember went dinner
seven lunch right around two. using memory reconstruct certain
sets events past get sense relative positioning within time, okay?
retrospective, current time interval measurements, prospective
time measurement future. beauty time perception human nervous
system boils couple simple molecules govern whether not
fine-slicing time whether not batching time larger bins.
molecules go names maybe heard, things like dopamine
norepinephrine, neuromodulators, called neuromodulators modulate,
change way neural circuits work. Also things like serotonin. Serotonin
released different site brain dopamine epinephrin
different effect time perception. just give example things like
dopamine

00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead Time Overestimation; Frame Rate

serotonin can modulate perception time, want focus little bit
literature now done fortunately animals humans
essentially shows dopamine released brain,
tend overestimate amount time just passed. Let repeat that.


dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role
molecules

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car
screams blood, or, know, things sort, neural activity gets
repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will
divorce sensation experience somewhat, will divorce
perception experience governed dopamine increase
frame rate. isn't clear, just know this. ice bath, dopamine
levels high. dopamine levels high, experience discomfort

00:56:30 Fun “Feels Fast” Remembered Slow; Boring Stuff “Feels Slow,”
Recall Fast

ice bath higher resolution. Now, now, talking
dopamine, extent, serotonin can differentially impact perception
fast slowly things happening moment. remember,
prospective time, experience time moment,
retrospective time beautiful studies showed
dopaminergic state changes way not just experience things now,
changes way remember things past rate
things occurred. opposite direction. make simple,
something experience fun varied, meaning lot different
components is, words, associated increase dopamine
brain, will experience going fast. Now, different
ice bath just said experienced going slowly, talking
something fun varied really like feel like goes
very, fast. Imagine amazing day kid amusement park. can
ton things. new. excited feel like goes fast,
later will remember experience long, long day full
many, many events. paradoxical relationship
perceive fun, exciting, varied events present remember
past. who've gone vacation, amazing day
vacation, it'll seem like, amazing vacation overall, will seem like goes


fast. last day vacation, sort go, whoa, went fast 'cause
much happening. memory six eight months later, remember, wow, just
went, know, long, long thing. this. that.
this. that. tends spool longer memory actual
experience. Conversely, bored something something really
don't like, going seem like takes long time go experience
moment, retroactively, looking back, will seem like moment short.
day waiting waiting room dentist, pretty boring.
just kind sitting there. wasn't much going on. seem like going
awfully long time, indeed, looking back, just seems like, okay, sat
room, not much happened. seems like short time bin. seems
efficiency brain stores information, dopamine associated, course,
fun varied experiences low dopamine associated kind empty,
boring, time seem like long experiences. whole thing
stamped scientific literature earlier experiments take
human beings isolate certain environments. know, take away
clocks watches cues time day time night
allow people life can either read work things
little do. people isolated boring environments
don't access time cues, time dilates. tend assume time
gone very, long. reason bring aren't just driven
circadian clocks circannual clocks ultradian clocks.
driven timers vary depending level excitement vary
depending level excitement neuromodulators, dopamine
serotonin. way like think two clocks, two
stopwatches. One dopaminergic stopwatch fine-slices really closely. like,
counts off milliseconds grabbing movie experience high
resolution. hand, stopwatch gathering big time bins,
big ticks along the, know, hand moving bigger intervals, know, marking
off time. depending whether not excited whether not bored,
using different stopwatches time

01:00:54 Retrospective Time, Context Variation & Enhanced Bonding Places &
People



therefore perceiving experience differently. One interesting aspect
way neuromodulators like dopamine novelty interact time perception
memory perceive relationship places people. really
interesting literature showing novel experiences place,
feel know place, obviously, longer feel there.
kind gedanken thought experiment illustrates literature.
say move New York City. happen really like New York City.
never lived there, say lived there. lived given apartment year
number different experiences mental experiment. say
100 different exciting new experiences. end year feel
lived certain period time, one year. actually know lived one
year. however lived three different places New York City met three times
many people three times many novel experiences, actually feel
much longer lived one location. also true
social interactions. move multiple several novel environments
somebody else, tend feel know person much better
know us much better. Now, course, get opportunity interact
people different contexts indeed get opportunity see them,
instance, coffee shop, order coffee. maybe go sports event,
act there. Maybe interact family. getting sense
different contexts. certainly playing role, seems
novelty experience somebody, not familiar you,
time feel spent them, even though total amount time can
exactly same. interesting aspect perception
time neuromodulators novelty can shape way not just
perceive

01:03:00 Dopamine Release Resets Start Time Bin Experience

given event world, relate place relate person.
talked lot different neurochemicals neurochemicals can
influence perception time. haven't talked lot neural circuits
various areas brain underlie this. want touch highlighting


really wonderful study. study published "Neuron," also Cell Press journal,
excellent journal. title paper "Behavioral, Physiological, Neural
Signatures Surprise Naturalistic Sports Viewing." experiment really
cool. brain imaging individuals watching basketball games.
basketball games actually took place recorded subjects
watching basketball games cases, not all, interest
win lose, cases, not all, subjects studies prior
knowledge team thought better, team likely win not
likely win. basic findings study measure surprise
release dopamine two areas brain, part called, called,
excuse me, mesolimbic reward pathway. two areas brain
important nucleus accumbens VTA, ventral tegmental area.
areas release dopamine kind token reward time something
surprising positive expectation met, okay? predict team dribbling
court going score drive get ball basket, little bit
dopamine released. two brain areas light functional imaging so-called
FSRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging used study. really
interesting study not just dopamine released time
something subject wanted see happened, right, time wanted see
team score, scored, also surprise. thought instance,
hit button predict team going score particular
drive didn't, well, dopamine also released response
surprise. speaks dopamine something important not just
positive events, unexpected events. Now, interesting speaks
fact dopamine kind flexible currency brain. doled out, will,
released something one hopes will happen happens released
surprise, even kind negative surprise. not something
subject wanted happen. interesting thing relates time
perception. found regardless caused dopamine release,
frequency dopamine release predicted subjects parsed time bins
game watching. mean that? Well, watch basketball
game watch anything, children playing talking spouse whatever,
batching time. batching time? Well, batch meal the,
don't know, appetizer, main course, dessert, turns not


doing. batching time according frequency dopamine pulses,
frequency dopamine release. saw study.
evaluated people's perceptions passage time, found
matched not whether not the, know, particular time point game, not
whether not team going court running back court play
defense, dopamine released served markers predict frame
rate perception experience. sounds complicated, mean
often release dopamine actually setting frame rate
entire perception everything, not just positive events negative events.
means going life, dopamine release dopamine
saying now new phase life even short, right?
get morning really need cup coffee, probably know,
wait 90 minutes 120 minutes drink coffee, get coffee
surely dopamine hit there, promise you, actually starting carve
day according dopamine hits. Consciously subconsciously,

01:07:40 Habits & Time Perception; Tool 10 (Setting Functional Units Day)

actually carving experience according getting dopamine
throughout day. governance perception time dopamine
points clear, actionable, powerful tool. tool
many people talked habits. People discussed habits
variety contexts context dopamine reward time perception,
means placing specific habitual routines particular intervals throughout
day very, not just convenient, good way incorporate dopamine
system divide day series call functional units.
look like? mean waking one specific habit
always engage causes release dopamine. can say, well, great.
That'll make feel good. agree. Dopamine released generally makes us
feel motivated additional effect marking time day
beginning particular time bin. inserting another habit, perhaps beginning
of, don't know, breakfast something, recognizing habit
fairly habitual, don't be, know, obsessively precise
timing, regular sequencing things going lead not just dopamine release


relates reward motivation feeling good, actually becomes way
carve entire experience day. almost circular
argument. say, well, course, know, one thing, next,
next, perceive day. day. list.
to-do list, et cetera. saying basis study,
mention first author, last name Antony. Antony et al. published
2020. study basketball viewing, points engaging specific
habits know can perform well, actually setting frame rate
day. think will soon come time human beings not just thinking
of, okay, morning routine afternoon routine, think can useful,
fact, used mentioned structure sort earlier episode, rather thinking
actually going level biology, dopamine
marking time. Habits clear way can invoke dopamine release
therefore provide time markers, means that, instance,
morning, might insert habit one habit two at, say, don't know, 8 10 AM,
that, marks epoch, little batch time morning routine
distinct second half morning. words, habits serve

found perception shorter time intervals also really disrupted.
ask measure off two minutes, normally people pretty good measuring
off two minutes. People come within, know, 5 15 seconds most. kind
sit just wait, pretty good idea two minutes up.
say two minutes up. Well, people's circadian clocks circadian
entrainment, say, disrupted, perception time measurement
shorter timescales minutes even seconds greatly disrupted. see
couple minutes, actually causes great problems contend work,
contend challenges different kinds. want circadian entrainment
pretty locked pretty entrained outside light-dark cycle
perception time shorter time intervals can precise ability
perceive time accurately given task given thing involved turns

00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus

one fundamental ways predicts well poorly perform
thing task. talked circannual entrainment, matching
cells tissues organs body 365-day journey Earth takes
around sun year talked circadian entrainment, way
24-hour genetic protein clocks every one cells matched
rotation Earth axis exposure lack exposure sun
rotation axis. Next like talk so-called ultradian entrainment.
Ultradian rhythms rhythms 90 minutes existence
broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. go sleep night, whether
not sleep six hours four hours eight hours 10 hours, entire period
sleep broken 90-minute ultradian cycles. Early night, tend
slow-wave sleep. Later night, tend REM sleep.
nonetheless, sleep broken 90-minute cycles. However,
wake morning, many things governed ultradian
rhythms. instance, work, meaning math try learn language
physical work kind work out, 90-minute time block seems
one brain can enter state focus alertness hard work
focus, focus, focus 90 minutes, significant drop ability
engage mental physical work. Now, everybody from, know, self-help


literature business literature pop psychology literature tried leverage
ultradian cycles saying going something hard want
focus it, limit 90 minutes less. one people also joined
conversation indeed use 90-minute work cycles, think extremely
powerful. One never expect going drop immediately state
high focus beginning remain 90 minutes. struggle
varying degrees achieve focus motivation drive within 90-minute
cycles. true, meaning ample literature support idea
90 minutes, tend go state less ability focus. isn't
time perception per se, example entrainment. entraining to,
right? Just can focus 90 minutes not well 100 minutes
120 minutes, entraining to? Well, entraining release
particular neurochemicals, case, acetylcholine dopamine allow brain
focus particular periods time, 90 minutes so, 90 minutes
so, amount chemicals can released tends drop low,
ability focus becomes diminished. one like explore
kind backbone basis ultradian rhythms, goes different name.
originally called basic rest-activity cycle. proposed many years
ago Nathaniel Kleitman. established true within sleep states
mentioned before. debated long time whether not 90-minute
cycles also control ability focus perform work wakeful states turns
do. Now lot literature support that. always get question
know 90 minute cycle begins? words, say wake
8 just finished 90-minute sleep cycle. mean next 90-
minute cycle work begins right 8:01? No, interesting thing
basic rest-activity cycles, ultradian rhythms, can initiate
whenever want. not like circadian rhythm hardwired
unerring signal 24 hours. ultradian rhythms occur sleep hardwired,
unerring. don't get option making sleep cycles 120 minutes five
minutes. don't get option. decide want apply ultradian
rhythms work performance, can set clock decide, okay, now focus
begins. Now work begins 90-minute cycle period going
work. actually this, know, mid morning sometimes twice day,
90-minute cycle limit distraction much possible, put away phone,


often turn off internet well. talked episode kind optimal
workday, least me, just give example might work. want
emphasize ultradian rhythms ones set. decide
going work 90 minutes. can't negotiate, however, 100
minutes 120 minutes, no matter are, going see diminishment
performance. not going focus well. way
90-minute cycles linked ability neurons release acetylcholine
dopamine extent norepinephrine, things give us narrow focus,
motivation, drive, way 90-minute cycles involved circuits.
90 minutes, circuits far less willing engage therefore
much harder continue focus high degree. people like multiple 90-
minute cycles per day focus. case, need separate out. can't
one 90-minute cycle, go right another 90-minute cycle, another 90-
minutes cycle. can't cheat circuits related acetylcholine dopamine
norepinephrine unfortunately. suggest people no three ideally
two just one 90-minute cycles. say ideally? Well,
taxing. narrow tunnel focus. me, can one mid
morning. can probably another one afternoon. not kind work
like checking email text messaging social media. focused hard
work, working hard problems various kinds, will different everybody.
recommend spaced least two four hours people
probably won't able handle two per day. probably
mutants three four, exceedingly rare. think even
one day going feel like significant mental investment, afterwards
going feel pretty taxed. now talked circannual,

00:31:42 Sense Passage Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective

circadian, ultradian rhythms, haven't really talked time perception per
se. mainly talked subconscious slow oscillatory ways
entrained matched year day ultradian cycles can
impose work can leverage toward focus like.
actual perception time? actually controls fast slowly
perceive time going by? basically three forms time perception


aware of. One perception passage time present,
quickly slowly things seem happening us. kind like interval timer
ticking off time. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. either fine-slicing like that, tick, tick,
tick. interval timers. discuss basis interval timers. also
engage called prospective timing like stopwatch measuring off things
go forward. might sound little bit like just described actually
little bit different. instance, told start measuring off two-minute time
interval future, pretty well. told measure
five-minute time interval future couldn't use clocks watches
phone anything like that, set tick marks.
decide many times going count off five-minute time block.
also retrospective time measure off time past. say,
know, last week, know went park, things friends,
know, went evening. long lunch went
dinner friends? probably think, okay, well, remember went dinner
seven lunch right around two. using memory reconstruct certain
sets events past get sense relative positioning within time, okay?
retrospective, current time interval measurements, prospective
time measurement future. beauty time perception human nervous
system boils couple simple molecules govern whether not
fine-slicing time whether not batching time larger bins.
molecules go names maybe heard, things like dopamine
norepinephrine, neuromodulators, called neuromodulators modulate,
change way neural circuits work. Also things like serotonin. Serotonin
released different site brain dopamine epinephrin
different effect time perception. just give example things like
dopamine

00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead Time Overestimation; Frame Rate

serotonin can modulate perception time, want focus little bit
literature now done fortunately animals humans
essentially shows dopamine released brain,
tend overestimate amount time just passed. Let repeat that.


dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role
molecules

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car
screams blood, or, know, things sort, neural activity gets
repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will
divorce sensation experience somewhat, will divorce
perception experience governed dopamine increase
frame rate. isn't clear, just know this. ice bath, dopamine
levels high. dopamine levels high, experience discomfort

00:56:30 Fun “Feels Fast” Remembered Slow; Boring Stuff “Feels Slow,”
Recall Fast

ice bath higher resolution. Now, now, talking
dopamine, extent, serotonin can differentially impact perception
fast slowly things happening moment. remember,
prospective time, experience time moment,
retrospective time beautiful studies showed
dopaminergic state changes way not just experience things now,
changes way remember things past rate
things occurred. opposite direction. make simple,
something experience fun varied, meaning lot different
components is, words, associated increase dopamine
brain, will experience going fast. Now, different
ice bath just said experienced going slowly, talking
something fun varied really like feel like goes
very, fast. Imagine amazing day kid amusement park. can
ton things. new. excited feel like goes fast,
later will remember experience long, long day full
many, many events. paradoxical relationship
perceive fun, exciting, varied events present remember
past. who've gone vacation, amazing day
vacation, it'll seem like, amazing vacation overall, will seem like goes


fast. last day vacation, sort go, whoa, went fast 'cause
much happening. memory six eight months later, remember, wow, just
went, know, long, long thing. this. that.
this. that. tends spool longer memory actual
experience. Conversely, bored something something really
don't like, going seem like takes long time go experience
moment, retroactively, looking back, will seem like moment short.
day waiting waiting room dentist, pretty boring.
just kind sitting there. wasn't much going on. seem like going
awfully long time, indeed, looking back, just seems like, okay, sat
room, not much happened. seems like short time bin. seems
efficiency brain stores information, dopamine associated, course,
fun varied experiences low dopamine associated kind empty,
boring, time seem like long experiences. whole thing
stamped scientific literature earlier experiments take
human beings isolate certain environments. know, take away
clocks watches cues time day time night
allow people life can either read work things
little do. people isolated boring environments
don't access time cues, time dilates. tend assume time
gone very, long. reason bring aren't just driven
circadian clocks circannual clocks ultradian clocks.
driven timers vary depending level excitement vary
depending level excitement neuromodulators, dopamine
serotonin. way like think two clocks, two
stopwatches. One dopaminergic stopwatch fine-slices really closely. like,
counts off milliseconds grabbing movie experience high
resolution. hand, stopwatch gathering big time bins,
big ticks along the, know, hand moving bigger intervals, know, marking
off time. depending whether not excited whether not bored,
using different stopwatches time

01:00:54 Retrospective Time, Context Variation & Enhanced Bonding Places &
People



therefore perceiving experience differently. One interesting aspect
way neuromodulators like dopamine novelty interact time perception
memory perceive relationship places people. really
interesting literature showing novel experiences place,
feel know place, obviously, longer feel there.
kind gedanken thought experiment illustrates literature.
say move New York City. happen really like New York City.
never lived there, say lived there. lived given apartment year
number different experiences mental experiment. say
100 different exciting new experiences. end year feel
lived certain period time, one year. actually know lived one
year. however lived three different places New York City met three times
many people three times many novel experiences, actually feel
much longer lived one location. also true
social interactions. move multiple several novel environments
somebody else, tend feel know person much better
know us much better. Now, course, get opportunity interact
people different contexts indeed get opportunity see them,
instance, coffee shop, order coffee. maybe go sports event,
act there. Maybe interact family. getting sense
different contexts. certainly playing role, seems
novelty experience somebody, not familiar you,
time feel spent them, even though total amount time can
exactly same. interesting aspect perception
time neuromodulators novelty can shape way not just
perceive

01:03:00 Dopamine Release Resets Start Time Bin Experience

given event world, relate place relate person.
talked lot different neurochemicals neurochemicals can
influence perception time. haven't talked lot neural circuits
various areas brain underlie this. want touch highlighting


really wonderful study. study published "Neuron," also Cell Press journal,
excellent journal. title paper "Behavioral, Physiological, Neural
Signatures Surprise Naturalistic Sports Viewing." experiment really
cool. brain imaging individuals watching basketball games.
basketball games actually took place recorded subjects
watching basketball games cases, not all, interest
win lose, cases, not all, subjects studies prior
knowledge team thought better, team likely win not
likely win. basic findings study measure surprise
release dopamine two areas brain, part called, called,
excuse me, mesolimbic reward pathway. two areas brain
important nucleus accumbens VTA, ventral tegmental area.
areas release dopamine kind token reward time something
surprising positive expectation met, okay? predict team dribbling
court going score drive get ball basket, little bit
dopamine released. two brain areas light functional imaging so-called
FSRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging used study. really
interesting study not just dopamine released time
something subject wanted see happened, right, time wanted see
team score, scored, also surprise. thought instance,
hit button predict team going score particular
drive didn't, well, dopamine also released response
surprise. speaks dopamine something important not just
positive events, unexpected events. Now, interesting speaks
fact dopamine kind flexible currency brain. doled out, will,
released something one hopes will happen happens released
surprise, even kind negative surprise. not something
subject wanted happen. interesting thing relates time
perception. found regardless caused dopamine release,
frequency dopamine release predicted subjects parsed time bins
game watching. mean that? Well, watch basketball
game watch anything, children playing talking spouse whatever,
batching time. batching time? Well, batch meal the,
don't know, appetizer, main course, dessert, turns not


doing. batching time according frequency dopamine pulses,
frequency dopamine release. saw study.
evaluated people's perceptions passage time, found
matched not whether not the, know, particular time point game, not
whether not team going court running back court play
defense, dopamine released served markers predict frame
rate perception experience. sounds complicated, mean
often release dopamine actually setting frame rate
entire perception everything, not just positive events negative events.
means going life, dopamine release dopamine
saying now new phase life even short, right?
get morning really need cup coffee, probably know,
wait 90 minutes 120 minutes drink coffee, get coffee
surely dopamine hit there, promise you, actually starting carve
day according dopamine hits. Consciously subconsciously,

01:07:40 Habits & Time Perception; Tool 10 (Setting Functional Units Day)

actually carving experience according getting dopamine
throughout day. governance perception time dopamine
points clear, actionable, powerful tool. tool
many people talked habits. People discussed habits
variety contexts context dopamine reward time perception,
means placing specific habitual routines particular intervals throughout
day very, not just convenient, good way incorporate dopamine
system divide day series call functional units.
look like? mean waking one specific habit
always engage causes release dopamine. can say, well, great.
That'll make feel good. agree. Dopamine released generally makes us
feel motivated additional effect marking time day
beginning particular time bin. inserting another habit, perhaps beginning
of, don't know, breakfast something, recognizing habit
fairly habitual, don't be, know, obsessively precise
timing, regular sequencing things going lead not just dopamine release


relates reward motivation feeling good, actually becomes way
carve entire experience day. almost circular
argument. say, well, course, know, one thing, next,
next, perceive day. day. list.
to-do list, et cetera. saying basis study,
mention first author, last name Antony. Antony et al. published
2020. study basketball viewing, points engaging specific
habits know can perform well, actually setting frame rate
day. think will soon come time human beings not just thinking
of, okay, morning routine afternoon routine, think can useful,
fact, used mentioned structure sort earlier episode, rather thinking
actually going level biology, dopamine
marking time. Habits clear way can invoke dopamine release
therefore provide time markers, means that, instance,
morning, might insert habit one habit two at, say, don't know, 8 10 AM,
that, marks epoch, little batch time morning routine
distinct second half morning. words, habits serve
flankers markers passage day. Now, seems kind hyper-

literature business literature pop psychology literature tried leverage
ultradian cycles saying going something hard want
focus it, limit 90 minutes less. one people also joined
conversation indeed use 90-minute work cycles, think extremely
powerful. One never expect going drop immediately state
high focus beginning remain 90 minutes. struggle
varying degrees achieve focus motivation drive within 90-minute
cycles. true, meaning ample literature support idea
90 minutes, tend go state less ability focus. isn't
time perception per se, example entrainment. entraining to,
right? Just can focus 90 minutes not well 100 minutes
120 minutes, entraining to? Well, entraining release
particular neurochemicals, case, acetylcholine dopamine allow brain
focus particular periods time, 90 minutes so, 90 minutes
so, amount chemicals can released tends drop low,
ability focus becomes diminished. one like explore
kind backbone basis ultradian rhythms, goes different name.
originally called basic rest-activity cycle. proposed many years
ago Nathaniel Kleitman. established true within sleep states
mentioned before. debated long time whether not 90-minute
cycles also control ability focus perform work wakeful states turns
do. Now lot literature support that. always get question
know 90 minute cycle begins? words, say wake
8 just finished 90-minute sleep cycle. mean next 90-
minute cycle work begins right 8:01? No, interesting thing
basic rest-activity cycles, ultradian rhythms, can initiate
whenever want. not like circadian rhythm hardwired
unerring signal 24 hours. ultradian rhythms occur sleep hardwired,
unerring. don't get option making sleep cycles 120 minutes five
minutes. don't get option. decide want apply ultradian
rhythms work performance, can set clock decide, okay, now focus
begins. Now work begins 90-minute cycle period going
work. actually this, know, mid morning sometimes twice day,
90-minute cycle limit distraction much possible, put away phone,


often turn off internet well. talked episode kind optimal
workday, least me, just give example might work. want
emphasize ultradian rhythms ones set. decide
going work 90 minutes. can't negotiate, however, 100
minutes 120 minutes, no matter are, going see diminishment
performance. not going focus well. way
90-minute cycles linked ability neurons release acetylcholine
dopamine extent norepinephrine, things give us narrow focus,
motivation, drive, way 90-minute cycles involved circuits.
90 minutes, circuits far less willing engage therefore
much harder continue focus high degree. people like multiple 90-
minute cycles per day focus. case, need separate out. can't
one 90-minute cycle, go right another 90-minute cycle, another 90-
minutes cycle. can't cheat circuits related acetylcholine dopamine
norepinephrine unfortunately. suggest people no three ideally
two just one 90-minute cycles. say ideally? Well,
taxing. narrow tunnel focus. me, can one mid
morning. can probably another one afternoon. not kind work
like checking email text messaging social media. focused hard
work, working hard problems various kinds, will different everybody.
recommend spaced least two four hours people
probably won't able handle two per day. probably
mutants three four, exceedingly rare. think even
one day going feel like significant mental investment, afterwards
going feel pretty taxed. now talked circannual,

00:31:42 Sense Passage Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective

circadian, ultradian rhythms, haven't really talked time perception per
se. mainly talked subconscious slow oscillatory ways
entrained matched year day ultradian cycles can
impose work can leverage toward focus like.
actual perception time? actually controls fast slowly
perceive time going by? basically three forms time perception


aware of. One perception passage time present,
quickly slowly things seem happening us. kind like interval timer
ticking off time. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. either fine-slicing like that, tick, tick,
tick. interval timers. discuss basis interval timers. also
engage called prospective timing like stopwatch measuring off things
go forward. might sound little bit like just described actually
little bit different. instance, told start measuring off two-minute time
interval future, pretty well. told measure
five-minute time interval future couldn't use clocks watches
phone anything like that, set tick marks.
decide many times going count off five-minute time block.
also retrospective time measure off time past. say,
know, last week, know went park, things friends,
know, went evening. long lunch went
dinner friends? probably think, okay, well, remember went dinner
seven lunch right around two. using memory reconstruct certain
sets events past get sense relative positioning within time, okay?
retrospective, current time interval measurements, prospective
time measurement future. beauty time perception human nervous
system boils couple simple molecules govern whether not
fine-slicing time whether not batching time larger bins.
molecules go names maybe heard, things like dopamine
norepinephrine, neuromodulators, called neuromodulators modulate,
change way neural circuits work. Also things like serotonin. Serotonin
released different site brain dopamine epinephrin
different effect time perception. just give example things like
dopamine

00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead Time Overestimation; Frame Rate

serotonin can modulate perception time, want focus little bit
literature now done fortunately animals humans
essentially shows dopamine released brain,
tend overestimate amount time just passed. Let repeat that.


dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role
molecules

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car
screams blood, or, know, things sort, neural activity gets
repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will
divorce sensation experience somewhat, will divorce
perception experience governed dopamine increase
frame rate. isn't clear, just know this. ice bath, dopamine
levels high. dopamine levels high, experience discomfort

00:56:30 Fun “Feels Fast” Remembered Slow; Boring Stuff “Feels Slow,”
Recall Fast

ice bath higher resolution. Now, now, talking
dopamine, extent, serotonin can differentially impact perception
fast slowly things happening moment. remember,
prospective time, experience time moment,
retrospective time beautiful studies showed
dopaminergic state changes way not just experience things now,
changes way remember things past rate
things occurred. opposite direction. make simple,
something experience fun varied, meaning lot different
components is, words, associated increase dopamine
brain, will experience going fast. Now, different
ice bath just said experienced going slowly, talking
something fun varied really like feel like goes
very, fast. Imagine amazing day kid amusement park. can
ton things. new. excited feel like goes fast,
later will remember experience long, long day full
many, many events. paradoxical relationship
perceive fun, exciting, varied events present remember
past. who've gone vacation, amazing day
vacation, it'll seem like, amazing vacation overall, will seem like goes


fast. last day vacation, sort go, whoa, went fast 'cause
much happening. memory six eight months later, remember, wow, just
went, know, long, long thing. this. that.
this. that. tends spool longer memory actual
experience. Conversely, bored something something really
don't like, going seem like takes long time go experience
moment, retroactively, looking back, will seem like moment short.
day waiting waiting room dentist, pretty boring.
just kind sitting there. wasn't much going on. seem like going
awfully long time, indeed, looking back, just seems like, okay, sat
room, not much happened. seems like short time bin. seems
efficiency brain stores information, dopamine associated, course,
fun varied experiences low dopamine associated kind empty,
boring, time seem like long experiences. whole thing
stamped scientific literature earlier experiments take
human beings isolate certain environments. know, take away
clocks watches cues time day time night
allow people life can either read work things
little do. people isolated boring environments
don't access time cues, time dilates. tend assume time
gone very, long. reason bring aren't just driven
circadian clocks circannual clocks ultradian clocks.
driven timers vary depending level excitement vary
depending level excitement neuromodulators, dopamine
serotonin. way like think two clocks, two
stopwatches. One dopaminergic stopwatch fine-slices really closely. like,
counts off milliseconds grabbing movie experience high
resolution. hand, stopwatch gathering big time bins,
big ticks along the, know, hand moving bigger intervals, know, marking
off time. depending whether not excited whether not bored,
using different stopwatches time

01:00:54 Retrospective Time, Context Variation & Enhanced Bonding Places &
People



therefore perceiving experience differently. One interesting aspect
way neuromodulators like dopamine novelty interact time perception
memory perceive relationship places people. really
interesting literature showing novel experiences place,
feel know place, obviously, longer feel there.
kind gedanken thought experiment illustrates literature.
say move New York City. happen really like New York City.
never lived there, say lived there. lived given apartment year
number different experiences mental experiment. say
100 different exciting new experiences. end year feel
lived certain period time, one year. actually know lived one
year. however lived three different places New York City met three times
many people three times many novel experiences, actually feel
much longer lived one location. also true
social interactions. move multiple several novel environments
somebody else, tend feel know person much better
know us much better. Now, course, get opportunity interact
people different contexts indeed get opportunity see them,
instance, coffee shop, order coffee. maybe go sports event,
act there. Maybe interact family. getting sense
different contexts. certainly playing role, seems
novelty experience somebody, not familiar you,
time feel spent them, even though total amount time can
exactly same. interesting aspect perception
time neuromodulators novelty can shape way not just
perceive

01:03:00 Dopamine Release Resets Start Time Bin Experience

given event world, relate place relate person.
talked lot different neurochemicals neurochemicals can
influence perception time. haven't talked lot neural circuits
various areas brain underlie this. want touch highlighting


really wonderful study. study published "Neuron," also Cell Press journal,
excellent journal. title paper "Behavioral, Physiological, Neural
Signatures Surprise Naturalistic Sports Viewing." experiment really
cool. brain imaging individuals watching basketball games.
basketball games actually took place recorded subjects
watching basketball games cases, not all, interest
win lose, cases, not all, subjects studies prior
knowledge team thought better, team likely win not
likely win. basic findings study measure surprise
release dopamine two areas brain, part called, called,
excuse me, mesolimbic reward pathway. two areas brain
important nucleus accumbens VTA, ventral tegmental area.
areas release dopamine kind token reward time something
surprising positive expectation met, okay? predict team dribbling
court going score drive get ball basket, little bit
dopamine released. two brain areas light functional imaging so-called
FSRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging used study. really
interesting study not just dopamine released time
something subject wanted see happened, right, time wanted see
team score, scored, also surprise. thought instance,
hit button predict team going score particular
drive didn't, well, dopamine also released response
surprise. speaks dopamine something important not just
positive events, unexpected events. Now, interesting speaks
fact dopamine kind flexible currency brain. doled out, will,
released something one hopes will happen happens released
surprise, even kind negative surprise. not something
subject wanted happen. interesting thing relates time
perception. found regardless caused dopamine release,
frequency dopamine release predicted subjects parsed time bins
game watching. mean that? Well, watch basketball
game watch anything, children playing talking spouse whatever,
batching time. batching time? Well, batch meal the,
don't know, appetizer, main course, dessert, turns not


doing. batching time according frequency dopamine pulses,
frequency dopamine release. saw study.
evaluated people's perceptions passage time, found
matched not whether not the, know, particular time point game, not
whether not team going court running back court play
defense, dopamine released served markers predict frame
rate perception experience. sounds complicated, mean
often release dopamine actually setting frame rate
entire perception everything, not just positive events negative events.
means going life, dopamine release dopamine
saying now new phase life even short, right?
get morning really need cup coffee, probably know,
wait 90 minutes 120 minutes drink coffee, get coffee
surely dopamine hit there, promise you, actually starting carve
day according dopamine hits. Consciously subconsciously,

01:07:40 Habits & Time Perception; Tool 10 (Setting Functional Units Day)

actually carving experience according getting dopamine
throughout day. governance perception time dopamine
points clear, actionable, powerful tool. tool
many people talked habits. People discussed habits
variety contexts context dopamine reward time perception,
means placing specific habitual routines particular intervals throughout
day very, not just convenient, good way incorporate dopamine
system divide day series call functional units.
look like? mean waking one specific habit
always engage causes release dopamine. can say, well, great.
That'll make feel good. agree. Dopamine released generally makes us
feel motivated additional effect marking time day
beginning particular time bin. inserting another habit, perhaps beginning
of, don't know, breakfast something, recognizing habit
fairly habitual, don't be, know, obsessively precise
timing, regular sequencing things going lead not just dopamine release


relates reward motivation feeling good, actually becomes way
carve entire experience day. almost circular
argument. say, well, course, know, one thing, next,
next, perceive day. day. list.
to-do list, et cetera. saying basis study,
mention first author, last name Antony. Antony et al. published
2020. study basketball viewing, points engaging specific
habits know can perform well, actually setting frame rate
day. think will soon come time human beings not just thinking
of, okay, morning routine afternoon routine, think can useful,
fact, used mentioned structure sort earlier episode, rather thinking
actually going level biology, dopamine
marking time. Habits clear way can invoke dopamine release
therefore provide time markers, means that, instance,
morning, might insert habit one habit two at, say, don't know, 8 10 AM,
that, marks epoch, little batch time morning routine
distinct second half morning. words, habits serve
flankers markers passage day. Now, seems kind hyper-
neurotic want structure life like that, say many people
well structure life like utilize habits not just sake
habit, fact habits serve marker
way can evoke dopamine release. that, able
segment day bunch smaller, want smaller, larger
functional units. anyone wants experiment this, Huberman Lab Podcast

decide many times going count off five-minute time block.
also retrospective time measure off time past. say,
know, last week, know went park, things friends,
know, went evening. long lunch went
dinner friends? probably think, okay, well, remember went dinner
seven lunch right around two. using memory reconstruct certain
sets events past get sense relative positioning within time, okay?
retrospective, current time interval measurements, prospective
time measurement future. beauty time perception human nervous
system boils couple simple molecules govern whether not
fine-slicing time whether not batching time larger bins.
molecules go names maybe heard, things like dopamine
norepinephrine, neuromodulators, called neuromodulators modulate,
change way neural circuits work. Also things like serotonin. Serotonin
released different site brain dopamine epinephrin
different effect time perception. just give example things like
dopamine

00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead Time Overestimation; Frame Rate

serotonin can modulate perception time, want focus little bit
literature now done fortunately animals humans
essentially shows dopamine released brain,
tend overestimate amount time just passed. Let repeat that.


dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role
molecules

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car
screams blood, or, know, things sort, neural activity gets
repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will
divorce sensation experience somewhat, will divorce
perception experience governed dopamine increase
frame rate. isn't clear, just know this. ice bath, dopamine
levels high. dopamine levels high, experience discomfort

00:56:30 Fun “Feels Fast” Remembered Slow; Boring Stuff “Feels Slow,”

ice bath higher resolution. Now, now, talking
dopamine, extent, serotonin can differentially impact perception
fast slowly things happening moment. remember,
prospective time, experience time moment,
retrospective time beautiful studies showed
dopaminergic state changes way not just experience things now,
changes way remember things past rate
things occurred. opposite direction. make simple,
something experience fun varied, meaning lot different

ice bath just said experienced going slowly, talking
something fun varied really like feel like goes
very, fast. Imagine amazing day kid amusement park. can
ton things. new. excited feel like goes fast,
later will remember experience long, long day full
many, many events. paradoxical relationship
perceive fun, exciting, varied events present remember
past. who've gone vacation, amazing day
vacation, it'll seem like, amazing vacation overall, will seem like goes


fast. last day vacation, sort go, whoa, went fast 'cause
much happening. memory six eight months later, remember, wow, just
went, know, long, long thing. this. that.
this. that. tends spool longer memory actual

don't like, going seem like takes long time go experience
moment, retroactively, looking back, will seem like moment short.
day waiting waiting room dentist, pretty boring.
just kind sitting there. wasn't much going on. seem like going
awfully long time, indeed, looking back, just seems like, okay, sat
room, not much happened. seems like short time bin. seems
efficiency brain stores information, dopamine associated, course,
fun varied experiences low dopamine associated kind empty,
boring, time seem like long experiences. whole thing
stamped scientific literature earlier experiments take
human beings isolate certain environments. know, take away
clocks watches cues time day time night
allow people life can either read work things
little do. people isolated boring environments
don't access time cues, time dilates. tend assume time
gone very, long. reason bring aren't just driven
circadian clocks circannual clocks ultradian clocks.
driven timers vary depending level excitement vary
depending level excitement neuromodulators, dopamine
serotonin. way like think two clocks, two
stopwatches. One dopaminergic stopwatch fine-slices really closely. like,
counts off milliseconds grabbing movie experience high
resolution. hand, stopwatch gathering big time bins,
big ticks along the, know, hand moving bigger intervals, know, marking
off time. depending whether not excited whether not bored,
using different stopwatches time

therefore perceiving experience differently. One interesting aspect
way neuromodulators like dopamine novelty interact time perception
memory perceive relationship places people. really
interesting literature showing novel experiences place,
feel know place, obviously, longer feel there.
kind gedanken thought experiment illustrates literature.
say move New York City. happen really like New York City.
never lived there, say lived there. lived given apartment year
number different experiences mental experiment. say
100 different exciting new experiences. end year feel
lived certain period time, one year. actually know lived one
year. however lived three different places New York City met three times
many people three times many novel experiences, actually feel
much longer lived one location. also true
social interactions. move multiple several novel environments
somebody else, tend feel know person much better
know us much better. Now, course, get opportunity interact
people different contexts indeed get opportunity see them,
instance, coffee shop, order coffee. maybe go sports event,
act there. Maybe interact family. getting sense
different contexts. certainly playing role, seems
novelty experience somebody, not familiar you,
time feel spent them, even though total amount time can

cool. brain imaging individuals watching basketball games.
basketball games actually took place recorded subjects
watching basketball games cases, not all, interest

court going score drive get ball basket, little bit
dopamine released. two brain areas light functional imaging so-called
FSRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging used study. really
interesting study not just dopamine released time
something subject wanted see happened, right, time wanted see
team score, scored, also surprise. thought instance,
hit button predict team going score particular
drive didn't, well, dopamine also released response
surprise. speaks dopamine something important not just
positive events, unexpected events. Now, interesting speaks
fact dopamine kind flexible currency brain. doled out, will,
released something one hopes will happen happens released
surprise, even kind negative surprise. not something
subject wanted happen. interesting thing relates time

therefore provide time markers, means that, instance,
morning, might insert habit one habit two at, say, don't know, 8 10 AM,
that, marks epoch, little batch time morning routine
distinct second half morning. words, habits serve
flankers markers passage day. Now, seems kind hyper-

dopamine released brain, tend overestimate
much time passed. experiments straight, straightforward, excuse
me, objective, really nice, can give people
animal drug increases amount dopamine ask measure off
without measurement device like watch clock one minute passed.
dopamine levels rise brain, people tend think minute
minute. they, 38-second mark, say, okay, think minute up.
overestimated much time passed, okay? higher level
dopamine, people tend overestimate. Now, also true norepinephrine,
also called noradrenaline, plays role role similar dopamine
norepinephrine dopamine close cousins, may
recall actually manufactured one another, okay? dopamine can
actually make epinephrin norepinephrine biochemically. cascade
dopamine can made norepinephrine epinephrin, remarkable.
elevated levels dopamine norepinephrine cause one overestimate
much time passed? Well, way causes fine-slicing
time bins. fine-slicing time bins like increasing frame rate
camera, right? Slow motion achieved movies elsewhere increasing
frame rate. take movie 30 frames per second watch it, will appear
certain speed, right? 'Cause just snapshots, 30 frames per second.
contrast, took movie 4,000 frames per second, fine-slicing
going see every little detail play one frames,
going look like moved slower, okay? Whatever, kind jump shot
basketball done slowly, slow motion consequence higher frame rate.
dopamine norepinephrine increase frame rate,

00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate

consequence, tend lead us overestimate amount time
passed. Conversely, neuromodulator serotonin causes people underestimate
amount time passed. done experiments. actually
done experiments using, humans, drugs increase serotonin.
also done cannabis increases serotonin among things including
cannabinoid receptor activation. people elevated levels 5-HT


whether not ingested cannabis, tend underestimate much time
passed. equivalent experiment. tell people guess
tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage

tell five minutes, instance, passed. Just use five minutes
example time. generally will miss five-minute mark. will think,
let six minutes pass think five minutes
underestimated much time passed. serotonin
related molecules brain tend lead slower frame rates, right? take
frame rate example used 4,000 frames per second to, say, 20
frames per second. interesting. interesting terms
pharmacology can used adjust time perception also interesting
context circadian rhythm. emerging evidence throughout
24-hour cycle, robust changes amount dopamine, norepinephrine,
serotonin present brain bloodstream body depending time
day within circadian cycle. Now, not talking sleep. sleep,
definitely variations things like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
talked episodes sleep. just talking role
molecules

00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across Day; Tool 7: Rigid vs. Creative
Work

time perception wakefulness. much evidence points fact
first half day, approximate first half day, dopamine norepinephrine
elevated brain, body, bloodstream much serotonin
second half day particular towards evening nighttime, serotonin
levels going up. think fairly well-established now. means based
just discussed role dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin
setting frame rate time perception perception passage time will
different early part day latter half day.
starting evidence support this, early day, people tend
overestimate much time passed later day, tend
underestimate much time passed. independent taking kind
substance increase decrease dopamine serotonin. Now,
important terms one thinks structuring day, know many


people thinking various tasks need throughout day.
Many, say literature, least can find productivity
things sort point idea hardest task, thing
want least important task early day kind
psychological tool getting done feeling accomplished something
think excellent protocol, frankly, not sure excellent protocol
way sense accomplishment least not excellent
protocol way sense accomplishment. Another reason move
something hard early part day indeed
dopaminergic noradrenergic circuits active time, actually
better position cognitively parse hard problem way
able fine-slice perception time fine-slice perceptual events outside
us. really saying early day, much high
resolution camera, speak, later day. Now, different types
tasks different types things require different frame rates different ways
perceiving time, indeed, also lends tool whereby activities
involve kind creative thinking aren't constrained particular answers
outcomes need kind blend different aspects memory,
different aspects task utilization, words, creative works, brainstorming,
things bit fluid, speak, serotonergic second half
day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car
screams blood, or, know, things sort, neural activity gets
repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will
divorce sensation experience somewhat, will divorce
perception experience governed dopamine increase
frame rate. isn't clear, just know this. ice bath, dopamine

day, way serotonergic second half day lends
time perception, may actually beneficial sorts tasks. put
reference couple studies point idea higher
dopaminergic states, better certain sorts tasks
serotonergic states, better sorts tasks dopamine
tends earlier day serotonin later day, speak.
broad, painting broad strokes here, think lend
really excellent tools think understand value something
hard challenging early day, ask hard
challenging how?

00:42:38 Example Tool 7

task actually really require terms time perception? people


might appreciate examples might work. Basically saying
work involves adhering rigid rules, math recipe
execution musical scales physical skills accounting something requires
lot precision right wrong answer hard, suggest
early part day way dopamine
norepinephrine impact time perception. literally better slicing time,
higher resolution brain times, going lend better
events demands require high resolution, whereas afternoon
calling serotonergic state, going better brainstorming
creative works flexibility terms batching time
perceiving time

00:43:38 Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance

isn't much rigid oversight right wrong answer. aside
support said also take us back critical role circadian rhythm,
lot evidence one's sleep disrupted, sleep either
short fragmented not high enough quality enough days, one first
things happen dysregulation dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
serotonergic states throughout day. get kind mish-mashed up. not
total mess aren't cleanly defined. think one
reasons haven't slept well haven't slept enough, tend feel
little off, like can't concentrate. Part lack concentration due things
part concentration due fact sense passage
time disrupted. seems value keeping dopaminergic
noradrenergic state kind limited early part day

00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates Experience

serotonergic state, calling it, kind pushed towards second half
day. Now, version dopamine norepinephrine can impact
perception passage time ways can disruptive even
maladaptive best example aware trauma. Many people
car accidents experienced form major trauma


called overclocking. Overclocking levels dopamine norepinephrine
increase much particular event, level alertness increased much
given event fine-slice. words, frame rate increased
much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car

repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four
rate, storage memory not going one, two, three, four, okay?
words, space code, say, meaning particular neurons
fire important, rate code, quickly neurons fire relative
firing, timing firing neurons also part memory. affords
memory system tremendous flexibility. means can take
set neurons hippocampus stamp many, many memories
use match different rates different neurons
firing order set code, right? Otherwise, needed different set
neurons every memory, need enormous hippocampus. need
enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will

therefore provide time markers, means that, instance,
morning, might insert habit one habit two at, say, don't know, 8 10 AM,
that, marks epoch, little batch time morning routine
distinct second half morning. words, habits serve
flankers markers passage day. Now, seems kind hyper-

excellent journal. title paper "Behavioral, Physiological, Neural
Signatures Surprise Naturalistic Sports Viewing." experiment really
cool. brain imaging individuals watching basketball games.
basketball games actually took place recorded subjects
watching basketball games cases, not all, interest
win lose, cases, not all, subjects studies prior
knowledge team thought better, team likely win not
likely win. basic findings study measure surprise
release dopamine two areas brain, part called, called,
excuse me, mesolimbic reward pathway. two areas brain
important nucleus accumbens VTA, ventral tegmental area.
areas release dopamine kind token reward time something
surprising positive expectation met, okay? predict team dribbling
court going score drive get ball basket, little bit
dopamine released. two brain areas light functional imaging so-called
FSRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging used study. really
interesting study not just dopamine released time
something subject wanted see happened, right, time wanted see
team score, scored, also surprise. thought instance,
hit button predict team going score particular
drive didn't, well, dopamine also released response
surprise. speaks dopamine something important not just
positive events, unexpected events. Now, interesting speaks
fact dopamine kind flexible currency brain. doled out, will,
released something one hopes will happen happens released
surprise, even kind negative surprise. not something
subject wanted happen. interesting thing relates time
perception. found regardless caused dopamine release,
frequency dopamine release predicted subjects parsed time bins
game watching. mean that? Well, watch basketball
game watch anything, children playing talking spouse whatever,
batching time. batching time? Well, batch meal the,
don't know, appetizer, main course, dessert, turns not

means going life, dopamine release dopamine
saying now new phase life even short, right?
get morning really need cup coffee, probably know,
wait 90 minutes 120 minutes drink coffee, get coffee
surely dopamine hit there, promise you, actually starting carve

look like? mean waking one specific habit
always engage causes release dopamine. can say, well, great.
That'll make feel good. agree. Dopamine released generally makes us
feel motivated additional effect marking time day
beginning particular time bin. inserting another habit, perhaps beginning

much perceive things happening ultra slow motion. Now, might not
seem like bad thing overall problem overclocking way
information gets stamped memory system. memory system,
involves areas brain like hippocampus also neocortex, basically
space-time recorder. mean space-time recorder? Well, nervous
system, course, housed darkness skull. doesn't whole lot
information outside world except light coming eyes
whatever happens hit ears terms sound waves skin forth
take neural signals create record happened. Now,
doesn't create record everything happened car accidents trauma
things sort oftentimes stamped record happened.
gets stamped down, actually mean phrase stamped
precise firing sequence neurons reflected events, say
car accident, certain neurons firing flipping car

repeated hippocampus sequence firing neurons
also remembered. not just neuron one, two, three, four fired sequence.
also neuron one, two, three, four fired particular rate. one,
two, three, four actual event memory stored firing
neurons one, two, three, four, right? event, one, two, three, four

enormous head. think get basic idea. Overclocking case
frame rate high memory gets stamped people hard


time shaking memory emotions associated memory. not
topic today's conversation will cover trauma future episode detail,
many treatments trauma, EMDR, nowadays lot excitement also
ketamine therapies, exposure therapies, know, like cognitive behavioral
therapies involve not just trying reduce amount emotion associated
memory, also deliberate speeding slowing memory.
words, trying allow person experienced trauma take control rate
experience memory, not just whether not memory happened all.
fact, know, one first things trauma victims learn aren't going
forget happened. eventually going happen ideally good treatment
emotional weight experience will eventually divorced
memory experience. done trying reduce amount
emotional activation recall experience one best ways
alter rate memory playback. words, taking firing
neurons might've one, two, three, four, again, much
complicated, one, two, three, four car crash getting memory play
back rate one, two, three, four, even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
words, allowing person instructing person take control rate
playback, way, seems still yet unknown mechanism
people can uncouple emotional weight associated memory.
overclocking kind extreme example dopaminergic
neurogenetic system ramped high people this, unfortunately,
seems like indelible mark brain particular event.

00:50:04 Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal

again, trauma treatment designed uncouple emotional load event.
probably saying dopamine trauma? thought dopamine
feel-good molecule. Well, reality, dopamine not necessarily molecule
reward. molecule motivation, pursuit, drive. close
relationship dopamine norepinephrine, oftentimes co-released.
whether not dopamine released car crashes forms trauma,
don't know know dopamine system noradrenergic
system, say noradrenergic, mean norepinephrine, systems


greatly increased anytime heightened state arousal. arousal can
negative valence, like meaning associated event really hate,
prefer not involved in, can positive valence, dopamine
norepinephrine kind common hallmark things elevated arousal.
see evidence dopamine

00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time

working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine

fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level

associated changes time perception positive events
negative events. interesting relationship arousal, dopamine, time
perception, blinking, supported really interesting paper, first
author, Terhune last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. published "Current Biology."
Cell Press journal. Excellent journal. title paper "Time Dilates
Spontaneous Blinking." heightened states arousal associated heightened
levels dopamine. now know dopamine leads kind fine-slicing time
one ways fine-slice time blinking. know, think blinking
just thing lubricate eyes limit amount light coming eyes,
shutter experience. much information coming brain
eyes impacts attention. said podcast, cognitive
attention follows visual attention, least sighted individuals. Well, turns
dopamine increases dopamine associated increases spontaneous
blink rate. aroused are, awake are, number
effects. Pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera, also blink rate increases.
every time blink, study cleanly shows, shift perception time, leading to,
mentioned before, overestimations time. seems though way,
blink rate actually related frame rate. very, interesting way
think leveraging wanted actually slow
perception time, blink less. want speed
perception time, blink more. Now, think scenario
useful you. Obviously going blink, going miss things
well. think interesting parameter visual attention relates
time perception, really speaks neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin adjust frame rate, not magical
mechanism. fact, no single brain area can say controls time


perception. haven't said today, oh, know, striatum. Well, involves
striatum not going say, instance, oh, cerebellum. cerebellum
definitely involved timing movement, something future podcast, time
perception call distributed phenomenon. network areas brain
working together. dopamine way relates shuttering eyes
seems controlling frame rate experience.

00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate
Discomfort

Numerous times podcast, talked cold exposure nowadays
lot interest things like cold showers, ice baths, immersion cold water tanks
lakes oceans things sort. lot different positive effects
cold exposure provided done properly. can lead increases metabolism, brown
fat stores, good fat stores want. sort like furnace
allow heat up, stay warm cold environments, reduce inflammation,
increase resilience forth. study published "European Journal
Physiology" showing cold exposure can increase baseline levels dopamine
robustly, 2.5x, long-lasting increase dopamine appears healthy
one, meaning doesn't seem addictive. sure people
addicted ice baths, but, know, think range dopamine-
inducing behaviors addictive, seems health-promoting side.
interesting cold water exposure increases dopamine, will also
change perception time ever done one cold water
exposures, experienced this. experienced getting feeling like, wow,
making three minutes really, really long time, fine-slicing time.
frame rate going up. Part that, just kind coarse level thinking,
painful. don't like this. want get out, right? part also dopamine
levels going quickly therefore perception discomfort also
fine-sliced. leverage tool, instance, try
entrain thinking something immediate experience, right?
kind controversy, will, cold exposure world. question try
lean experience really feel it, try distract yourself,
know, sing song count off, know, one hundred. Just know


whatever tactic use get cold exposure dopamine level
now increased system going cause fine-slice experience
slow motion. minute going seem like lot longer minute reality.
could, instance, decide pay attention external cue. Maybe
metronome ticks every 10 seconds. decide think something
else. decide sing song head sing song loud. will
divorce sensation experience somewhat, will divorce

day waiting waiting room dentist, pretty boring.
just kind sitting there. wasn't much going on. seem like going
awfully long time, indeed, looking back, just seems like, okay, sat

efficiency brain stores information, dopamine associated, course,
fun varied experiences low dopamine associated kind empty,
boring, time seem like long experiences. whole thing
stamped scientific literature earlier experiments take
human beings isolate certain environments. know, take away

really wonderful study. study published "Neuron," also Cell Press journal,
excellent journal. title paper "Behavioral, Physiological, Neural
Signatures Surprise Naturalistic Sports Viewing." experiment really
cool. brain imaging individuals watching basketball games.
basketball games actually took place recorded subjects
watching basketball games cases, not all, interest
win lose, cases, not all, subjects studies prior
knowledge team thought better, team likely win not
likely win. basic findings study measure surprise
release dopamine two areas brain, part called, called,
excuse me, mesolimbic reward pathway. two areas brain
important nucleus accumbens VTA, ventral tegmental area.
areas release dopamine kind token reward time something
surprising positive expectation met, okay? predict team dribbling
court going score drive get ball basket, little bit
dopamine released. two brain areas light functional imaging so-called
FSRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging used study. really
interesting study not just dopamine released time
something subject wanted see happened, right, time wanted see
team score, scored, also surprise. thought instance,
hit button predict team going score particular
drive didn't, well, dopamine also released response
surprise. speaks dopamine something important not just
positive events, unexpected events. Now, interesting speaks
fact dopamine kind flexible currency brain. doled out, will,
released something one hopes will happen happens released
surprise, even kind negative surprise. not something
subject wanted happen. interesting thing relates time
perception. found regardless caused dopamine release,
