major takeaways literature, spans back hundred years more,

remarkable features can leverage social contacts kinds.
think important exciting work social bonding comes
laboratory Kay Tye. Kay professor Salk Institute Biological Studies,
investigator Howard Hughes Medical Institute. recent years,
say last five six years, laboratory made fundamental
discovery seek put much effort social bonds. key
discovery made much like hunger, much like temperature, much like
thirst, brain circuits devoted called social homeostasis.
Many probably heard homeostasis before, homeostasis
characteristic various biological circuits even individual cells try maintain
certain level. easily thought context hunger, don't eat
while, drive pursue food think food make food spend money
food, indeed enjoy food goes up. Whereas well fed, don't
tend seek food much vigor much intensity, wouldn't invest
much time, effort, money, et cetera. homeostasis aspect cells, tissues,
organisms seek sort balance regulate themselves. crude way, can
think thermostat home homeostatic circuit. temperature
goes little bit, cools things maintain certain temperature.
room gets cold, hits certain level sensor detects that, clicks
heat goes maintain certain set temperature. simple way thinking
homeostasis. Every homeostatic circuit three components, least three,
one detector, meaning organism thermostat wall
way detecting going environment, right, context
social bonding, whether not interacting others whether not
interactions going well. detected, first thing.
control center, second thing. control center one
makes adjustments to, case social bonding, behavior
psychology. soon learn ways time


spend alone, motivated seek pictures faces,
interactions actual people, physical contact, forth. Now might seem
obvious you, thanks work Kay Tye others, remarkable learn
specific brain centers adjusting psychology biology
seek bonds aggressively, maybe don't perfectly
sated satiated respect much contact people. Now,
third component homeostatic circuit effector. effector actually
drives behavioral response, leads pick social media
start scrolling, leads text friend, leads call friend
make plans leads follow plans. again, three
components detector, control center, effector. soon learn,
neural circuit controls social homeostasis actually fourth component,
fourth component one places subjective understanding
doing, establishes place hierarchy. Now, know
word hierarchy can little bit barbed wire one people immediately start
thinking boss subordinate, couples, leader follower.
talk social hierarchies context human interactions, social hierarchies
plastic, meaning one setting, one person can leader, another setting,
person can leader. probably groups friends family
members constantly passing baton going drive,
going navigate, going pick restaurant, going clear dishes
going certain activities not others. hierarchies dynamic.
consequence, social plastic fluid move one
environment next, even people, able make
adjustments. case social homeostasis circuit, adjustments
made particular brain structure, talked podcast before, called
prefrontal cortex, seat higher consciousness, will.
allows us play subjective labels things not strictly input output, not
robotic. Meaning go dinner friend exceptional choosing
restaurants, well, context social homeostasis circuit, prefrontal cortex
allow pick restaurant basically dominant
capacity pick good restaurants, least example. Whereas leave
restaurant perhaps navigating get drink dinner,
walk city, perhaps better sense direction.

forth. course flowing nervous system,
detector underlies social homeostasis involves mainly two structures, one called
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex, BLA, basal lateral amygdala.
hear word amygdala, probably thinking fear. today,
see, amygdala actually many different sub compartments
components. reason basal lateral amygdala, associated
certain aspects aversive behaviors, meaning moving away certain types
things interactions, reason BLA integral part
detector system, just important form healthy social bonds,
vitally important try avoid unhealthy social bonds. basolateral
amygdala mainly associated aversive type responses just moving away
certain things. control center social homeostasis circuit involves brain
area called lateral hypothalamus periventricular hypothalamus. lateral
hypothalamus periventricular hypothalamus contain neurons able
access hormone system order influence release things like oxytocin,


hormone neuropeptide, got part hormone, part neurotransmitter, kind
hybrid, going talk lot oxytocin today. got ACC
BLA, areas mainly involved moving away things, although
also toward them, detector. got control center,
hypothalamus, special important area associated social
bonding want everyone learn, dorsal raphe nucleus DRN, dorsal
raphe nucleus. dorsal raphe nucleus small collection neurons midbrain,
deep brain. time hear raphe, R-A-P-H-E,
way, raphe nucleus, talking serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator
often associated feelings satiety eating, warmth, basically satisfaction
things already have. However, within dorsal raphe nucleus,
small subset neurons release dopamine. Dopamine neuromodulator
often associated movement, craving, motivation desire. neural circuits
rich dopamine things like substantia nigra, mesolimbic
dopamine system, VTA, nucleus accumbens, et cetera. names don't
mean anything you. However, unique population dopamine neurons
raphe truly unique responsible mediating calling social
homeostasis.

00:22:48 Social Homeostasis & Dopamine

effector response mediate social homeostasis. Now haven't told
exactly social homeostasis is. Social homeostasis, just like hunger, process
lack social interaction, start crave it. interesting
fact dopamine neurons raphe structure effector
social homeostasis, means not interacting people
frequency intensity, right you, dopamine released brain.
popular conversations dopamine, even scientific circles,
hear dopamine release, think reward feeling good, indeed many
behaviors drugs abuse increase dopamine. one reasons
much addictive potential. However, dopamine not associated feeling good,
actually neurochemical responsible movement toward things feel good.
zoom conceptualize here, brain area
detector either will move us toward away certain types experiences

neuropeptides brain blood, depending sorts interactions
happen having. response system, dorsal raphe
nucleus contains dopamine neurons. not interacting people
frequency intensity crave, dopamine released, dopamine
causes us seek social interactions particular kinds. talk
social homeostasis plays out. again, use hunger example.
say person eats every three four hours regularly. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, just accustomed eating every three four
hours. just suddenly steal meal fridge work, something not
do, just sake mental experimentation, probably cause go
seek food route. might buy food, probably upset first,
go buy food replace food going eat, hungry
food. indeed hormonal type mechanisms mechanisms
eat regularly predict food coming in, actually start
secreting insulin, mobilizing blood sugar, hormones
bloodstream make us hungry regular clock-like schedule, seek
food. Similarly, somebody accustomed lot social
interaction, suddenly take away social interaction, feel kind let
down, crave replacement social interaction. might upset
lunch date friend, used lunch every Wednesday,
cancel crave interaction. Okay, called pro-social
craving. indeed, see animals humans. you, called
acutely isolate them, just fancy scientific word saying deprive social
interactions short-term basis, start engaging pro-social behaviors, start
texting people, start seeking social interactions different kinds.
makes perfect sense, right? thought different side, also
imagine well, getting social interaction somebody daily
weekly basis, suddenly remove interaction, well, people might not
care, might just think, well, get interaction tomorrow next day
next day, sated, much way person eats
regularly might say, "Well, ate four hours ago, eat eight hours later, no big deal."
not happens. prediction going certain types
interactions, interactions don't happen, replace lack


interaction drive motivation seek social interaction. drive
motivation caused by, say,

00:27:00 Lack Social Interactions: Short- Versus Long-Term

driven dopamine release dorsal raphe. takeaway
lack social interaction expect, become pro-social. However,
chronically socially isolated, meaning don't interactions people long
time, become actually introverted. separate tachykinin
stuff talked earlier, falling states chronic stress, well-
established now humans animals, don't give enough social
interaction, actually become antisocial. actually little bit like
one might see long-term fasting. Okay, gave example eating every four
hours, now give parallel example somebody fasting perhaps
two three days, expecting eat, meal doesn't arrive,
not necessarily going immediately try seek food. little bit
counterintuitive, thought, well, haven't eaten long time,
going motivated seek food, no, accustomed
fasting. Similarly, social homeostasis circuit works way don't


00:28:10 Introverts & Extroverts

social interactions long time, start lose craving social interactions.
look social homeostasis circuit lens commonly called
introversion extroversion. Now, typically hear introverts, think
quiet person party, person doesn't want go all.
think extrovert somebody really social, so-called social
butterfly, enjoys social interactions, really chatty, kind life party type
person. cliche kind pop psychology cliche, actually
psychology literature, not really way holds up. Many people appear
introverted actually extroverted. quiet person party extrovert,
except just don't talk much. characteristic extrovert somebody
gets energy feels good social interactions, sort get lift, can


predict lift occurs release dopamine within brain
body. indeed evidence that, neuroimaging study support that, forms
neuro-biological analysis support well. can also imagine person
talking lot somebody extroverted, oftentimes people talk
lot work somebody social interact them,
person gets back car absolutely depleted exhausted
interaction sorts social interactions. really can't predict whether not
somebody introvert extrovert simply based behavior, really
internal subjective label. However, look introversion extroversion
lens social homeostatic set point, think dopamine
molecule drives motivation seek social interactions, can
reasonably assume introverts people engage certain forms
social interaction, either amount dopamine released greater
extrovert, right, said greater extrovert, actually feel
quite motivated, also satisfied brief, say sort sparse social
interactions. don't need lot social engagement feel sated. Again, parallel
example hunger. somebody doesn't need eat much
order feel satisfied. Whereas extrovert, can reasonably assume releases less
dopamine response individual social interaction. need much
social interaction order feel filled interaction. indeed supported
neuro-biological imaging studies. rather thinking introverts
extroverts chatty versus quiet, useful think people, maybe yourself,
maybe people know,

good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic
partners, important synchronization physiology
synchronization more, guess call rational predictive
type circuits. can leverage information, can start think sorts
bonds us feel enriching complete. know can have,
instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive
connection to. good example connection bulldog,
unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible
well-being, like parent infant, lost appetite weeks
house training seem lose ability process cognitive
information. Now also sleep deprived, entirely focused autonomic
bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

walk everything him, wonderful relationship. Now
clear talking form empathy. Empathy ability
feel, least think feel others feel. again, colleague
great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense
sensing people sensing, okay. no real way verify
except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see
experience something way mental level, emotional empathy idea
yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve
emotional empathy, autonomic function cognitive empathy, mutual
understanding person feels person thinks order
able make predictions going do. also clear based
emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional
empathy cognitive empathy required order establish call
trusting social bond. beautiful experiments done using neuroimaging
two individuals playing trust game, essentially game trying predict
person's behavior, whether not will behave trustworthy way.
experiments tend use real money, actually something stake,
can less predict whether not somebody feels lot trust somebody
else whether not believe will act trustworthy manner based
whether not high levels cognitive empathy emotional empathy.
seeking establish deeper bonds bonds kind,
important think synchronization bodily states, talked
earlier, synchronization cognitive states. Now doesn't mean
agree everything. fact, oftentimes people feel close one another
cognitively emotionally argue sorts things disagree lot

milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical

discovery made much like hunger, much like temperature, much like

way, raphe nucleus, talking serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator
often associated feelings satiety eating, warmth, basically satisfaction
things already have. However, within dorsal raphe nucleus,
small subset neurons release dopamine. Dopamine neuromodulator
often associated movement, craving, motivation desire. neural circuits
rich dopamine things like substantia nigra, mesolimbic

fact dopamine neurons raphe structure effector
social homeostasis, means not interacting people

popular conversations dopamine, even scientific circles,
hear dopamine release, think reward feeling good, indeed many
behaviors drugs abuse increase dopamine. one reasons
much addictive potential. However, dopamine not associated feeling good,
actually neurochemical responsible movement toward things feel good.

causes us seek social interactions particular kinds. talk
social homeostasis plays out. again, use hunger example.
say person eats every three four hours regularly. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, just accustomed eating every three four
hours. just suddenly steal meal fridge work, something not
do, just sake mental experimentation, probably cause go
seek food route. might buy food, probably upset first,
go buy food replace food going eat, hungry
food. indeed hormonal type mechanisms mechanisms
eat regularly predict food coming in, actually start
secreting insulin, mobilizing blood sugar, hormones
bloodstream make us hungry regular clock-like schedule, seek
food. Similarly, somebody accustomed lot social
interaction, suddenly take away social interaction, feel kind let
down, crave replacement social interaction. might upset
lunch date friend, used lunch every Wednesday,
cancel crave interaction. Okay, called pro-social
craving. indeed, see animals humans. you, called
acutely isolate them, just fancy scientific word saying deprive social
interactions short-term basis, start engaging pro-social behaviors, start
texting people, start seeking social interactions different kinds.
makes perfect sense, right? thought different side, also
imagine well, getting social interaction somebody daily
weekly basis, suddenly remove interaction, well, people might not
care, might just think, well, get interaction tomorrow next day
next day, sated, much way person eats
regularly might say, "Well, ate four hours ago, eat eight hours later, no big deal."
not happens. prediction going certain types
interactions, interactions don't happen, replace lack


interaction drive motivation seek social interaction. drive
motivation caused by, say,

00:27:00 Lack Social Interactions: Short- Versus Long-Term

driven dopamine release dorsal raphe. takeaway
lack social interaction expect, become pro-social. However,
chronically socially isolated, meaning don't interactions people long
time, become actually introverted. separate tachykinin
stuff talked earlier, falling states chronic stress, well-
established now humans animals, don't give enough social
interaction, actually become antisocial. actually little bit like
one might see long-term fasting. Okay, gave example eating every four
hours, now give parallel example somebody fasting perhaps
two three days, expecting eat, meal doesn't arrive,
not necessarily going immediately try seek food. little bit
counterintuitive, thought, well, haven't eaten long time,
going motivated seek food, no, accustomed
fasting. Similarly, social homeostasis circuit works way don't


00:28:10 Introverts & Extroverts

social interactions long time, start lose craving social interactions.
look social homeostasis circuit lens commonly called
introversion extroversion. Now, typically hear introverts, think
quiet person party, person doesn't want go all.
think extrovert somebody really social, so-called social
butterfly, enjoys social interactions, really chatty, kind life party type
person. cliche kind pop psychology cliche, actually
psychology literature, not really way holds up. Many people appear
introverted actually extroverted. quiet person party extrovert,
except just don't talk much. characteristic extrovert somebody
gets energy feels good social interactions, sort get lift, can


predict lift occurs release dopamine within brain
body. indeed evidence that, neuroimaging study support that, forms
neuro-biological analysis support well. can also imagine person
talking lot somebody extroverted, oftentimes people talk
lot work somebody social interact them,
person gets back car absolutely depleted exhausted
interaction sorts social interactions. really can't predict whether not
somebody introvert extrovert simply based behavior, really
internal subjective label. However, look introversion extroversion
lens social homeostatic set point, think dopamine
molecule drives motivation seek social interactions, can
reasonably assume introverts people engage certain forms
social interaction, either amount dopamine released greater
extrovert, right, said greater extrovert, actually feel

remarkable features can leverage social contacts kinds.
think important exciting work social bonding comes
laboratory Kay Tye. Kay professor Salk Institute Biological Studies,
investigator Howard Hughes Medical Institute. recent years,
say last five six years, laboratory made fundamental
discovery seek put much effort social bonds. key
discovery made much like hunger, much like temperature, much like
thirst, brain circuits devoted called social homeostasis.
Many probably heard homeostasis before, homeostasis
characteristic various biological circuits even individual cells try maintain
certain level. easily thought context hunger, don't eat
while, drive pursue food think food make food spend money
food, indeed enjoy food goes up. Whereas well fed, don't
tend seek food much vigor much intensity, wouldn't invest
much time, effort, money, et cetera. homeostasis aspect cells, tissues,
organisms seek sort balance regulate themselves. crude way, can
think thermostat home homeostatic circuit. temperature
goes little bit, cools things maintain certain temperature.
room gets cold, hits certain level sensor detects that, clicks
heat goes maintain certain set temperature. simple way thinking
homeostasis. Every homeostatic circuit three components, least three,
one detector, meaning organism thermostat wall
way detecting going environment, right, context
social bonding, whether not interacting others whether not
interactions going well. detected, first thing.
control center, second thing. control center one
makes adjustments to, case social bonding, behavior
psychology. soon learn ways time


spend alone, motivated seek pictures faces,
interactions actual people, physical contact, forth. Now might seem
obvious you, thanks work Kay Tye others, remarkable learn
specific brain centers adjusting psychology biology
seek bonds aggressively, maybe don't perfectly
sated satiated respect much contact people. Now,
third component homeostatic circuit effector. effector actually
drives behavioral response, leads pick social media
start scrolling, leads text friend, leads call friend
make plans leads follow plans. again, three
components detector, control center, effector. soon learn,
neural circuit controls social homeostasis actually fourth component,
fourth component one places subjective understanding
doing, establishes place hierarchy. Now, know
word hierarchy can little bit barbed wire one people immediately start
thinking boss subordinate, couples, leader follower.
talk social hierarchies context human interactions, social hierarchies
plastic, meaning one setting, one person can leader, another setting,
person can leader. probably groups friends family
members constantly passing baton going drive,
going navigate, going pick restaurant, going clear dishes
going certain activities not others. hierarchies dynamic.
consequence, social plastic fluid move one
environment next, even people, able make
adjustments. case social homeostasis circuit, adjustments
made particular brain structure, talked podcast before, called
prefrontal cortex, seat higher consciousness, will.
allows us play subjective labels things not strictly input output, not
robotic. Meaning go dinner friend exceptional choosing
restaurants, well, context social homeostasis circuit, prefrontal cortex
allow pick restaurant basically dominant
capacity pick good restaurants, least example. Whereas leave
restaurant perhaps navigating get drink dinner,
walk city, perhaps better sense direction.

forth. course flowing nervous system,
detector underlies social homeostasis involves mainly two structures, one called
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex, BLA, basal lateral amygdala.
hear word amygdala, probably thinking fear. today,
see, amygdala actually many different sub compartments
components. reason basal lateral amygdala, associated
certain aspects aversive behaviors, meaning moving away certain types
things interactions, reason BLA integral part
detector system, just important form healthy social bonds,
vitally important try avoid unhealthy social bonds. basolateral
amygdala mainly associated aversive type responses just moving away
certain things. control center social homeostasis circuit involves brain
area called lateral hypothalamus periventricular hypothalamus. lateral
hypothalamus periventricular hypothalamus contain neurons able
access hormone system order influence release things like oxytocin,


hormone neuropeptide, got part hormone, part neurotransmitter, kind
hybrid, going talk lot oxytocin today. got ACC
BLA, areas mainly involved moving away things, although
also toward them, detector. got control center,
hypothalamus, special important area associated social
bonding want everyone learn, dorsal raphe nucleus DRN, dorsal
raphe nucleus. dorsal raphe nucleus small collection neurons midbrain,
deep brain. time hear raphe, R-A-P-H-E,
way, raphe nucleus, talking serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator
often associated feelings satiety eating, warmth, basically satisfaction
things already have. However, within dorsal raphe nucleus,
small subset neurons release dopamine. Dopamine neuromodulator
often associated movement, craving, motivation desire. neural circuits
rich dopamine things like substantia nigra, mesolimbic
dopamine system, VTA, nucleus accumbens, et cetera. names don't
mean anything you. However, unique population dopamine neurons
raphe truly unique responsible mediating calling social
homeostasis.

00:22:48 Social Homeostasis & Dopamine

effector response mediate social homeostasis. Now haven't told
exactly social homeostasis is. Social homeostasis, just like hunger, process
lack social interaction, start crave it. interesting
fact dopamine neurons raphe structure effector
social homeostasis, means not interacting people
frequency intensity, right you, dopamine released brain.
popular conversations dopamine, even scientific circles,
hear dopamine release, think reward feeling good, indeed many
behaviors drugs abuse increase dopamine. one reasons
much addictive potential. However, dopamine not associated feeling good,
actually neurochemical responsible movement toward things feel good.
zoom conceptualize here, brain area
detector either will move us toward away certain types experiences


sensations. control center going release certain hormones
neuropeptides brain blood, depending sorts interactions
happen having. response system, dorsal raphe
nucleus contains dopamine neurons. not interacting people
frequency intensity crave, dopamine released, dopamine
causes us seek social interactions particular kinds. talk
social homeostasis plays out. again, use hunger example.
say person eats every three four hours regularly. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, just accustomed eating every three four
hours. just suddenly steal meal fridge work, something not
do, just sake mental experimentation, probably cause go
seek food route. might buy food, probably upset first,
go buy food replace food going eat, hungry
food. indeed hormonal type mechanisms mechanisms
eat regularly predict food coming in, actually start
secreting insulin, mobilizing blood sugar, hormones
bloodstream make us hungry regular clock-like schedule, seek
food. Similarly, somebody accustomed lot social
interaction, suddenly take away social interaction, feel kind let
down, crave replacement social interaction. might upset
lunch date friend, used lunch every Wednesday,
cancel crave interaction. Okay, called pro-social
craving. indeed, see animals humans. you, called
acutely isolate them, just fancy scientific word saying deprive social
interactions short-term basis, start engaging pro-social behaviors, start
texting people, start seeking social interactions different kinds.
makes perfect sense, right? thought different side, also
imagine well, getting social interaction somebody daily
weekly basis, suddenly remove interaction, well, people might not
care, might just think, well, get interaction tomorrow next day
next day, sated, much way person eats
regularly might say, "Well, ate four hours ago, eat eight hours later, no big deal."
not happens. prediction going certain types
interactions, interactions don't happen, replace lack


interaction drive motivation seek social interaction. drive
motivation caused by, say,

00:27:00 Lack Social Interactions: Short- Versus Long-Term

driven dopamine release dorsal raphe. takeaway
lack social interaction expect, become pro-social. However,
chronically socially isolated, meaning don't interactions people long
time, become actually introverted. separate tachykinin
stuff talked earlier, falling states chronic stress, well-
established now humans animals, don't give enough social
interaction, actually become antisocial. actually little bit like
one might see long-term fasting. Okay, gave example eating every four
hours, now give parallel example somebody fasting perhaps
two three days, expecting eat, meal doesn't arrive,
not necessarily going immediately try seek food. little bit
counterintuitive, thought, well, haven't eaten long time,
going motivated seek food, no, accustomed
fasting. Similarly, social homeostasis circuit works way don't


00:28:10 Introverts & Extroverts

social interactions long time, start lose craving social interactions.
look social homeostasis circuit lens commonly called
introversion extroversion. Now, typically hear introverts, think
quiet person party, person doesn't want go all.
think extrovert somebody really social, so-called social
butterfly, enjoys social interactions, really chatty, kind life party type
person. cliche kind pop psychology cliche, actually
psychology literature, not really way holds up. Many people appear
introverted actually extroverted. quiet person party extrovert,
except just don't talk much. characteristic extrovert somebody
gets energy feels good social interactions, sort get lift, can


predict lift occurs release dopamine within brain
body. indeed evidence that, neuroimaging study support that, forms
neuro-biological analysis support well. can also imagine person
talking lot somebody extroverted, oftentimes people talk
lot work somebody social interact them,
person gets back car absolutely depleted exhausted
interaction sorts social interactions. really can't predict whether not
somebody introvert extrovert simply based behavior, really
internal subjective label. However, look introversion extroversion
lens social homeostatic set point, think dopamine
molecule drives motivation seek social interactions, can
reasonably assume introverts people engage certain forms
social interaction, either amount dopamine released greater
extrovert, right, said greater extrovert, actually feel
quite motivated, also satisfied brief, say sort sparse social
interactions. don't need lot social engagement feel sated. Again, parallel
example hunger. somebody doesn't need eat much
order feel satisfied. Whereas extrovert, can reasonably assume releases less
dopamine response individual social interaction. need much
social interaction order feel filled interaction. indeed supported
neuro-biological imaging studies. rather thinking introverts
extroverts chatty versus quiet, useful think people, maybe yourself,
maybe people know,

laboratory Kay Tye. Kay professor Salk Institute Biological Studies,
investigator Howard Hughes Medical Institute. recent years,
say last five six years, laboratory made fundamental
discovery seek put much effort social bonds. key
discovery made much like hunger, much like temperature, much like
thirst, brain circuits devoted called social homeostasis.
Many probably heard homeostasis before, homeostasis

popular conversations dopamine, even scientific circles,
hear dopamine release, think reward feeling good, indeed many

causes us seek social interactions particular kinds. talk
social homeostasis plays out. again, use hunger example.
say person eats every three four hours regularly. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, just accustomed eating every three four
hours. just suddenly steal meal fridge work, something not
do, just sake mental experimentation, probably cause go
seek food route. might buy food, probably upset first,
go buy food replace food going eat, hungry
food. indeed hormonal type mechanisms mechanisms
eat regularly predict food coming in, actually start
secreting insulin, mobilizing blood sugar, hormones
bloodstream make us hungry regular clock-like schedule, seek
food. Similarly, somebody accustomed lot social

lunch date friend, used lunch every Wednesday,
cancel crave interaction. Okay, called pro-social
craving. indeed, see animals humans. you, called
acutely isolate them, just fancy scientific word saying deprive social
interactions short-term basis, start engaging pro-social behaviors, start
texting people, start seeking social interactions different kinds.
makes perfect sense, right? thought different side, also
imagine well, getting social interaction somebody daily
weekly basis, suddenly remove interaction, well, people might not
care, might just think, well, get interaction tomorrow next day
next day, sated, much way person eats
regularly might say, "Well, ate four hours ago, eat eight hours later, no big deal."
not happens. prediction going certain types
interactions, interactions don't happen, replace lack


interaction drive motivation seek social interaction. drive
motivation caused by, say,

00:27:00 Lack Social Interactions: Short- Versus Long-Term

driven dopamine release dorsal raphe. takeaway
lack social interaction expect, become pro-social. However,
chronically socially isolated, meaning don't interactions people long
time, become actually introverted. separate tachykinin
stuff talked earlier, falling states chronic stress, well-
established now humans animals, don't give enough social
interaction, actually become antisocial. actually little bit like
one might see long-term fasting. Okay, gave example eating every four
hours, now give parallel example somebody fasting perhaps
two three days, expecting eat, meal doesn't arrive,
not necessarily going immediately try seek food. little bit
counterintuitive, thought, well, haven't eaten long time,
going motivated seek food, no, accustomed
fasting. Similarly, social homeostasis circuit works way don't


00:28:10 Introverts & Extroverts

social interactions long time, start lose craving social interactions.
look social homeostasis circuit lens commonly called
introversion extroversion. Now, typically hear introverts, think
quiet person party, person doesn't want go all.
think extrovert somebody really social, so-called social
butterfly, enjoys social interactions, really chatty, kind life party type
person. cliche kind pop psychology cliche, actually
psychology literature, not really way holds up. Many people appear
introverted actually extroverted. quiet person party extrovert,
except just don't talk much. characteristic extrovert somebody
gets energy feels good social interactions, sort get lift, can


predict lift occurs release dopamine within brain
body. indeed evidence that, neuroimaging study support that, forms
neuro-biological analysis support well. can also imagine person
talking lot somebody extroverted, oftentimes people talk
lot work somebody social interact them,
person gets back car absolutely depleted exhausted
interaction sorts social interactions. really can't predict whether not
somebody introvert extrovert simply based behavior, really
internal subjective label. However, look introversion extroversion
lens social homeostatic set point, think dopamine
molecule drives motivation seek social interactions, can
reasonably assume introverts people engage certain forms
social interaction, either amount dopamine released greater
extrovert, right, said greater extrovert, actually feel
quite motivated, also satisfied brief, say sort sparse social
interactions. don't need lot social engagement feel sated. Again, parallel
example hunger. somebody doesn't need eat much
order feel satisfied. Whereas extrovert, can reasonably assume releases less
dopamine response individual social interaction. need much
social interaction order feel filled interaction. indeed supported
neuro-biological imaging studies. rather thinking introverts
extroverts chatty versus quiet, useful think people, maybe yourself,
maybe people know,

00:31:00 “Good” Versus “Bad” Social Interactions & Hierarchies

fourth component one places subjective understanding

word hierarchy can little bit barbed wire one people immediately start
thinking boss subordinate, couples, leader follower.

made particular brain structure, talked podcast before, called
prefrontal cortex, seat higher consciousness, will.
allows us play subjective labels things not strictly input output, not

detector underlies social homeostasis involves mainly two structures, one called
ACC, anterior cingulate cortex, BLA, basal lateral amygdala.

raphe nucleus. dorsal raphe nucleus small collection neurons midbrain,
deep brain. time hear raphe, R-A-P-H-E,
way, raphe nucleus, talking serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator
often associated feelings satiety eating, warmth, basically satisfaction
things already have. However, within dorsal raphe nucleus,
small subset neurons release dopamine. Dopamine neuromodulator
often associated movement, craving, motivation desire. neural circuits
rich dopamine things like substantia nigra, mesolimbic
dopamine system, VTA, nucleus accumbens, et cetera. names don't
mean anything you. However, unique population dopamine neurons
raphe truly unique responsible mediating calling social
homeostasis.

00:22:48 Social Homeostasis & Dopamine

effector response mediate social homeostasis. Now haven't told
exactly social homeostasis is. Social homeostasis, just like hunger, process
lack social interaction, start crave it. interesting
fact dopamine neurons raphe structure effector
social homeostasis, means not interacting people
frequency intensity, right you, dopamine released brain.
popular conversations dopamine, even scientific circles,
hear dopamine release, think reward feeling good, indeed many
behaviors drugs abuse increase dopamine. one reasons
much addictive potential. However, dopamine not associated feeling good,
actually neurochemical responsible movement toward things feel good.

causes us seek social interactions particular kinds. talk
social homeostasis plays out. again, use hunger example.
say person eats every three four hours regularly. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, just accustomed eating every three four
hours. just suddenly steal meal fridge work, something not
do, just sake mental experimentation, probably cause go
seek food route. might buy food, probably upset first,
go buy food replace food going eat, hungry
food. indeed hormonal type mechanisms mechanisms
eat regularly predict food coming in, actually start
secreting insulin, mobilizing blood sugar, hormones
bloodstream make us hungry regular clock-like schedule, seek
food. Similarly, somebody accustomed lot social
interaction, suddenly take away social interaction, feel kind let
down, crave replacement social interaction. might upset
lunch date friend, used lunch every Wednesday,
cancel crave interaction. Okay, called pro-social
craving. indeed, see animals humans. you, called
acutely isolate them, just fancy scientific word saying deprive social
interactions short-term basis, start engaging pro-social behaviors, start
texting people, start seeking social interactions different kinds.
makes perfect sense, right? thought different side, also
imagine well, getting social interaction somebody daily
weekly basis, suddenly remove interaction, well, people might not
care, might just think, well, get interaction tomorrow next day
next day, sated, much way person eats
regularly might say, "Well, ate four hours ago, eat eight hours later, no big deal."
not happens. prediction going certain types

00:27:00 Lack Social Interactions: Short- Versus Long-Term

driven dopamine release dorsal raphe. takeaway
lack social interaction expect, become pro-social. However,
chronically socially isolated, meaning don't interactions people long
time, become actually introverted. separate tachykinin
stuff talked earlier, falling states chronic stress, well-
established now humans animals, don't give enough social
interaction, actually become antisocial. actually little bit like
one might see long-term fasting. Okay, gave example eating every four
hours, now give parallel example somebody fasting perhaps
two three days, expecting eat, meal doesn't arrive,
not necessarily going immediately try seek food. little bit
counterintuitive, thought, well, haven't eaten long time,
going motivated seek food, no, accustomed
fasting. Similarly, social homeostasis circuit works way don't


00:28:10 Introverts & Extroverts

social interactions long time, start lose craving social interactions.
look social homeostasis circuit lens commonly called
introversion extroversion. Now, typically hear introverts, think
quiet person party, person doesn't want go all.
think extrovert somebody really social, so-called social
butterfly, enjoys social interactions, really chatty, kind life party type
person. cliche kind pop psychology cliche, actually
psychology literature, not really way holds up. Many people appear
introverted actually extroverted. quiet person party extrovert,
except just don't talk much. characteristic extrovert somebody
gets energy feels good social interactions, sort get lift, can


predict lift occurs release dopamine within brain
body. indeed evidence that, neuroimaging study support that, forms
neuro-biological analysis support well. can also imagine person
talking lot somebody extroverted, oftentimes people talk
lot work somebody social interact them,
person gets back car absolutely depleted exhausted
interaction sorts social interactions. really can't predict whether not
somebody introvert extrovert simply based behavior, really
internal subjective label. However, look introversion extroversion
lens social homeostatic set point, think dopamine
molecule drives motivation seek social interactions, can
reasonably assume introverts people engage certain forms
social interaction, either amount dopamine released greater
extrovert, right, said greater extrovert, actually feel
quite motivated, also satisfied brief, say sort sparse social
interactions. don't need lot social engagement feel sated. Again, parallel
example hunger. somebody doesn't need eat much
order feel satisfied. Whereas extrovert, can reasonably assume releases less
dopamine response individual social interaction. need much
social interaction order feel filled interaction. indeed supported
neuro-biological imaging studies. rather thinking introverts
extroverts chatty versus quiet, useful think people, maybe yourself,
maybe people know,

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits
already established. However, early episode, mentioned
neural circuits responsible social bonding adult forms attachment,
romantic friendship otherwise actually established development. One
important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult
attachment, comes us work Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N,
Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E psychoanalyst also deep understanding

see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side

However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left

social homeostasis plays out. again, use hunger example.
say person eats every three four hours regularly. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, just accustomed eating every three four
hours. just suddenly steal meal fridge work, something not

go buy food replace food going eat, hungry

acutely isolate them, just fancy scientific word saying deprive social

texting people, start seeking social interactions different kinds.
makes perfect sense, right? thought different side, also
imagine well, getting social interaction somebody daily

care, might just think, well, get interaction tomorrow next day

lack social interaction expect, become pro-social. However,
chronically socially isolated, meaning don't interactions people long
time, become actually introverted. separate tachykinin
stuff talked earlier, falling states chronic stress, well-
established now humans animals, don't give enough social
interaction, actually become antisocial. actually little bit like
one might see long-term fasting. Okay, gave example eating every four
hours, now give parallel example somebody fasting perhaps
two three days, expecting eat, meal doesn't arrive,
not necessarily going immediately try seek food. little bit
counterintuitive, thought, well, haven't eaten long time,
going motivated seek food, no, accustomed
fasting. Similarly, social homeostasis circuit works way don't


00:28:10 Introverts & Extroverts

social interactions long time, start lose craving social interactions.
look social homeostasis circuit lens commonly called
introversion extroversion. Now, typically hear introverts, think
quiet person party, person doesn't want go all.
think extrovert somebody really social, so-called social
butterfly, enjoys social interactions, really chatty, kind life party type
person. cliche kind pop psychology cliche, actually
psychology literature, not really way holds up. Many people appear
introverted actually extroverted. quiet person party extrovert,
except just don't talk much. characteristic extrovert somebody
gets energy feels good social interactions, sort get lift, can


predict lift occurs release dopamine within brain
body. indeed evidence that, neuroimaging study support that, forms
neuro-biological analysis support well. can also imagine person
talking lot somebody extroverted, oftentimes people talk
lot work somebody social interact them,
person gets back car absolutely depleted exhausted
interaction sorts social interactions. really can't predict whether not
somebody introvert extrovert simply based behavior, really
internal subjective label. However, look introversion extroversion
lens social homeostatic set point, think dopamine
molecule drives motivation seek social interactions, can
reasonably assume introverts people engage certain forms
social interaction, either amount dopamine released greater
extrovert, right, said greater extrovert, actually feel
quite motivated, also satisfied brief, say sort sparse social
interactions. don't need lot social engagement feel sated. Again, parallel
example hunger. somebody doesn't need eat much
order feel satisfied. Whereas extrovert, can reasonably assume releases less
dopamine response individual social interaction. need much
social interaction order feel filled interaction. indeed supported
neuro-biological imaging studies. rather thinking introverts
extroverts chatty versus quiet, useful think people, maybe yourself,

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits
already established. However, early episode, mentioned
neural circuits responsible social bonding adult forms attachment,
romantic friendship otherwise actually established development. One
important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult
attachment, comes us work Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N,
Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E psychoanalyst also deep understanding
neurobiology attachment, childhood adulthood. focused lot
differences right brain left brain forms attachment. Now early
episode Huberman Lab Podcast, touched fact
discussed general public sort pop psychology even neurobiology
courses right brain versus left brain, one side brain
emotional, side rational completely wrong. Okay,
see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side
brain emotional, side brain rational just simply not true.
However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left
brain right brain, underlies certain forms attachment child
parents, particular child mother, right brain-isms, will, left
brain-isms attachment, get played forms attachment
adults. like talk work briefly now, think really points
number important features establish bonds different routes
establishing bonds. within field psychoanalysis, longstanding
discussion, course, so-called unconscious subconscious, things
not aware of. think growing evidence pointing fact least
one major component subconscious unconscious so-called
autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system portion nervous

meaning sweating, pupil size, aspect nervous system makes us

parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic

early infant-parent, particular infant-mother attachment involves coordination
synchronization right brain circuits left brain circuits, relate,
excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed
yourself, can't warm yourself, can't change yourself, certainly can't
emulate walk anywhere get things need. functions,
needs rather met primary caretaker. Typically mother.
Fathers course play role also, breastfeeding even bottle feeding,
typically mothers play prominent role. realized exceptions,

rationality, autonomic versus conscious forms bonding.
left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side
brain emotional side rational, rather two things
happening parallel. bit dominance left brain circuitry
involved kinds bonding associated prediction reward.
good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,
predictable sort interaction. okay, come books, usually
bath, pajamas, lights go down, comes

million different, infinite number examples here, idea
two parallel circuits important establishing bonds,
set early childhood. neither emotional rational, both.
Now circuits tap circuitry talked earlier,

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance

active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic

them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive

unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible

quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different

clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see

yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve

emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional

going lots different effects. indeed does. Oxytocin involved orgasm,
involved social recognition. right, see people consider
people, team, group, friends, oxytocin released. Even don't
come physical contact them. Oxytocin also associated pair bonding,
feeling person, person, common language

different things. However, consistent effects oxytocin
worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved
milk, let reflex, lactation. makes perfect sense, needs cue
suckling nipple infant causes release let milk,
milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical
dilation allow baby pass birth canal. involved induction
breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear
females, sexual orgasm cause release oxytocin, whereas males,
sexual stimulation not cause release oxytocin, rather different molecule
vasopressin triggered sexual stimulation, orgasm trigger release


oxytocin males, delay 30 minutes. specific

lot people written asking inhaling oxytocin, asking whether

think extrovert somebody really social, so-called social
butterfly, enjoys social interactions, really chatty, kind life party type
person. cliche kind pop psychology cliche, actually

00:28:10 Introverts & Extroverts

social interactions long time, start lose craving social interactions.
look social homeostasis circuit lens commonly called
introversion extroversion. Now, typically hear introverts, think
quiet person party, person doesn't want go all.
think extrovert somebody really social, so-called social
butterfly, enjoys social interactions, really chatty, kind life party type
person. cliche kind pop psychology cliche, actually
psychology literature, not really way holds up. Many people appear
introverted actually extroverted. quiet person party extrovert,
except just don't talk much. characteristic extrovert somebody
gets energy feels good social interactions, sort get lift, can


predict lift occurs release dopamine within brain

neuro-biological analysis support well. can also imagine person
talking lot somebody extroverted, oftentimes people talk
lot work somebody social interact them,
person gets back car absolutely depleted exhausted
interaction sorts social interactions. really can't predict whether not
somebody introvert extrovert simply based behavior, really
internal subjective label. However, look introversion extroversion
lens social homeostatic set point, think dopamine
molecule drives motivation seek social interactions, can
reasonably assume introverts people engage certain forms
social interaction, either amount dopamine released greater
extrovert, right, said greater extrovert, actually feel
quite motivated, also satisfied brief, say sort sparse social
interactions. don't need lot social engagement feel sated. Again, parallel
example hunger. somebody doesn't need eat much
order feel satisfied. Whereas extrovert, can reasonably assume releases less
dopamine response individual social interaction. need much

There've studies people look one another look actually

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits
already established. However, early episode, mentioned
neural circuits responsible social bonding adult forms attachment,
romantic friendship otherwise actually established development. One
important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult
attachment, comes us work Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N,
Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E psychoanalyst also deep understanding
neurobiology attachment, childhood adulthood. focused lot

episode Huberman Lab Podcast, touched fact
discussed general public sort pop psychology even neurobiology
courses right brain versus left brain, one side brain
emotional, side rational completely wrong. Okay,
see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side
brain emotional, side brain rational just simply not true.
However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left

excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed

left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side

good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic

instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive

unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible

bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

walk everything him, wonderful relationship. Now
clear talking form empathy. Empathy ability

great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense
sensing people sensing, okay. no real way verify
except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see
experience something way mental level, emotional empathy idea
yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve
emotional empathy, autonomic function cognitive empathy, mutual
understanding person feels person thinks order
able make predictions going do. also clear based
emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional
empathy cognitive empathy required order establish call
trusting social bond. beautiful experiments done using neuroimaging
two individuals playing trust game, essentially game trying predict
person's behavior, whether not will behave trustworthy way.
experiments tend use real money, actually something stake,
can less predict whether not somebody feels lot trust somebody
else whether not believe will act trustworthy manner based
whether not high levels cognitive empathy emotional empathy.
seeking establish deeper bonds bonds kind,
important think synchronization bodily states, talked
earlier, synchronization cognitive states. Now doesn't mean
agree everything. fact, oftentimes people feel close one another
cognitively emotionally argue sorts things disagree lot

look social homeostasis circuit lens commonly called
introversion extroversion. Now, typically hear introverts, think
quiet person party, person doesn't want go all.
think extrovert somebody really social, so-called social
butterfly, enjoys social interactions, really chatty, kind life party type
person. cliche kind pop psychology cliche, actually
psychology literature, not really way holds up. Many people appear

reasonably assume introverts people engage certain forms
social interaction, either amount dopamine released greater
extrovert, right, said greater extrovert, actually feel
quite motivated, also satisfied brief, say sort sparse social
interactions. don't need lot social engagement feel sated. Again, parallel
example hunger. somebody doesn't need eat much
order feel satisfied. Whereas extrovert, can reasonably assume releases less

good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic
partners, important synchronization physiology
synchronization more, guess call rational predictive
type circuits. can leverage information, can start think sorts
bonds us feel enriching complete. know can have,
instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive
connection to. good example connection bulldog,
unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible
well-being, like parent infant, lost appetite weeks
house training seem lose ability process cognitive
information. Now also sleep deprived, entirely focused autonomic
bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

walk everything him, wonderful relationship. Now
clear talking form empathy. Empathy ability
feel, least think feel others feel. again, colleague
great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense
sensing people sensing, okay. no real way verify
except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see
experience something way mental level, emotional empathy idea
yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve
emotional empathy, autonomic function cognitive empathy, mutual
understanding person feels person thinks order
able make predictions going do. also clear based
emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional
empathy cognitive empathy required order establish call
trusting social bond. beautiful experiments done using neuroimaging
two individuals playing trust game, essentially game trying predict
person's behavior, whether not will behave trustworthy way.
experiments tend use real money, actually something stake,
can less predict whether not somebody feels lot trust somebody
else whether not believe will act trustworthy manner based

important think synchronization bodily states, talked
earlier, synchronization cognitive states. Now doesn't mean
agree everything. fact, oftentimes people feel close one another

going lots different effects. indeed does. Oxytocin involved orgasm,
involved social recognition. right, see people consider
people, team, group, friends, oxytocin released. Even don't

worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved

suckling nipple infant causes release let milk,
milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical
dilation allow baby pass birth canal. involved induction
breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear
females, sexual orgasm cause release oxytocin, whereas males,
sexual stimulation not cause release oxytocin, rather different molecule

people listen story, everybody study listened story,
listened story different times indeed different locations. different
people, story. measured things like heart rate, measured breathing,

literature showing physiology, things like heart rate, breathing, skin
conductance, meaning amount sweating, can synchronized
individuals, synchronization can occur according variety different things.
There've studies people look one another look actually
see pupil size eyes starts synchronize. People's breathing can
synchronize, people's body temperatures can even start synchronize, least shifts
body temperature can synchronize. One person gets cooler, person gets
cooler. lot subconscious, can detected conscious cues like
flushing skin, actually seeing someone's pupils change. actually pupil

individuals, people can't control pupil reflexes deliberate way,
truly reflex, autonomic reflex. lot literature showing within
small groups two people, physiological signals can synchronized.
study found people listen story, different times,
heart rates start synchronize. incredible people listening
story different times, gaps heartbeats become stereotype
map almost precisely onto one another. incredible. Now also know
extensive literature quality perceived depth social bond correlates

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits

important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult

episode Huberman Lab Podcast, touched fact
discussed general public sort pop psychology even neurobiology
courses right brain versus left brain, one side brain

see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side

However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left

excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed

Fathers course play role also, breastfeeding even bottle feeding,
typically mothers play prominent role. realized exceptions,

left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side

good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,

beautiful study published Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal,
excellent journal. title paper Conscious Processing Narrative Stimuli
Synchronizes Heart Rate Individuals. mentioned previous podcast,
like mention go little bit depth points
specific actionable items can use order enhance quality depth
social bonds kinds. Now study involved simple type experiment,
people listen story, everybody study listened story,
listened story different times indeed different locations. different
people, story. measured things like heart rate, measured breathing,
et cetera. Now, motivation this? Well, long standing
literature showing physiology, things like heart rate, breathing, skin
conductance, meaning amount sweating, can synchronized
individuals, synchronization can occur according variety different things.
There've studies people look one another look actually
see pupil size eyes starts synchronize. People's breathing can
synchronize, people's body temperatures can even start synchronize, least shifts
body temperature can synchronize. One person gets cooler, person gets
cooler. lot subconscious, can detected conscious cues like
flushing skin, actually seeing someone's pupils change. actually pupil
reflex really good example, whereby except rare cases certain highly trained


individuals, people can't control pupil reflexes deliberate way,
truly reflex, autonomic reflex. lot literature showing within
small groups two people, physiological signals can synchronized.
study found people listen story, different times,
heart rates start synchronize. incredible people listening
story different times, gaps heartbeats become stereotype
map almost precisely onto one another. incredible. Now also know
extensive literature quality perceived depth social bond correlates
strongly much physiological synchronization individuals.
words, bodies feel same, tend feel bonded
somebody else. whole thing rather circular argument, feel

physiologies synchronized, feel closer people.
call concert phenomenon, ever go see favorite band, go

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits
already established. However, early episode, mentioned
neural circuits responsible social bonding adult forms attachment,
romantic friendship otherwise actually established development. One
important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult
attachment, comes us work Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N,
Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E psychoanalyst also deep understanding
neurobiology attachment, childhood adulthood. focused lot
differences right brain left brain forms attachment. Now early
episode Huberman Lab Podcast, touched fact
discussed general public sort pop psychology even neurobiology
courses right brain versus left brain, one side brain
emotional, side rational completely wrong. Okay,
see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side
brain emotional, side brain rational just simply not true.
However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left
brain right brain, underlies certain forms attachment child
parents, particular child mother, right brain-isms, will, left
brain-isms attachment, get played forms attachment
adults. like talk work briefly now, think really points
number important features establish bonds different routes
establishing bonds. within field psychoanalysis, longstanding
discussion, course, so-called unconscious subconscious, things
not aware of. think growing evidence pointing fact least
one major component subconscious unconscious so-called
autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system portion nervous
system controls reflexive breathing, heart rate, skin conductance,
meaning sweating, pupil size, aspect nervous system makes us
alert calm. so-called sympathetic, meaning alertness,
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic

early infant-parent, particular infant-mother attachment involves coordination
synchronization right brain circuits left brain circuits, relate,
excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed
yourself, can't warm yourself, can't change yourself, certainly can't
emulate walk anywhere get things need. functions,
needs rather met primary caretaker. Typically mother.
Fathers course play role also, breastfeeding even bottle feeding,
typically mothers play prominent role. realized exceptions,
general rule. now brain imaging studies examining brains infants

two, breathing mother child, heart rate mother
child, indeed pupil size mother child actually actively getting
coordinated. words, mother regulating infant's autonomic nervous
system primarily, infant also regulating mother's autonomic nervous


system, small coup baby cry, stress cry baby will
definitely regulate autonomic nervous system mother. whole right brain
system directly tapped so-called oxytocin system, talk
oxytocin moment. Oxytocin again, peptide hormone involved
social bonds kinds, least early childhood closely associated

examples just holding child will evoke oxytocin release non-

emotional autonomic system, conscious detection. Now, get
older, another system starts come play parent-child interactions,
also comes play sibling interactions forth, left brain
system described Allan Schore. Now, again, isn't emotion versus
rationality, autonomic versus conscious forms bonding.
left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side
brain emotional side rational, rather two things
happening parallel. bit dominance left brain circuitry
involved kinds bonding associated prediction reward.
good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,
predictable sort interaction. okay, come books, usually
bath, pajamas, lights go down, comes


book, interaction parent child, course usually
also involves physical contact. not like right brain system left brain

carries children get older parents take evolve parenting

older, able access cognitively sophisticated things. can
watch movie make predictions characters going
show instance, can take concert can appreciate
concert play concert, appreciate appreciated. Okay,
million different, infinite number examples here, idea
two parallel circuits important establishing bonds,
set early childhood. neither emotional rational, both.
Now circuits tap circuitry talked earlier,
dopamine released molecules like serotonin, neuromodulator
associated feelings warmth, comfort, satisfaction immediate

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic

instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive

unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible
well-being, like parent infant, lost appetite weeks
house training seem lose ability process cognitive

bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense

except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see

yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve

emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional

going lots different effects. indeed does. Oxytocin involved orgasm,
involved social recognition. right, see people consider
people, team, group, friends, oxytocin released. Even don't
come physical contact them. Oxytocin also associated pair bonding,
feeling person, person, common language

worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved

suckling nipple infant causes release let milk,
milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical
dilation allow baby pass birth canal. involved induction
breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear
females, sexual orgasm cause release oxytocin, whereas males,
sexual stimulation not cause release oxytocin, rather different molecule
vasopressin triggered sexual stimulation, orgasm trigger release


oxytocin males, delay 30 minutes. specific

things packaged oxytocin system. not just one way system. Now,
lot people written asking inhaling oxytocin, asking whether

beautiful study published Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal,
excellent journal. title paper Conscious Processing Narrative Stimuli

like mention go little bit depth points
specific actionable items can use order enhance quality depth
social bonds kinds. Now study involved simple type experiment,
people listen story, everybody study listened story,
listened story different times indeed different locations. different
people, story. measured things like heart rate, measured breathing,
et cetera. Now, motivation this? Well, long standing
literature showing physiology, things like heart rate, breathing, skin
conductance, meaning amount sweating, can synchronized
individuals, synchronization can occur according variety different things.
There've studies people look one another look actually
see pupil size eyes starts synchronize. People's breathing can
synchronize, people's body temperatures can even start synchronize, least shifts
body temperature can synchronize. One person gets cooler, person gets
cooler. lot subconscious, can detected conscious cues like
flushing skin, actually seeing someone's pupils change. actually pupil

individuals, people can't control pupil reflexes deliberate way,
truly reflex, autonomic reflex. lot literature showing within
small groups two people, physiological signals can synchronized.
study found people listen story, different times,
heart rates start synchronize. incredible people listening

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits
already established. However, early episode, mentioned
neural circuits responsible social bonding adult forms attachment,
romantic friendship otherwise actually established development. One
important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult
attachment, comes us work Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N,
Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E psychoanalyst also deep understanding
neurobiology attachment, childhood adulthood. focused lot
differences right brain left brain forms attachment. Now early
episode Huberman Lab Podcast, touched fact
discussed general public sort pop psychology even neurobiology
courses right brain versus left brain, one side brain
emotional, side rational completely wrong. Okay,
see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side
brain emotional, side brain rational just simply not true.
However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left
brain right brain, underlies certain forms attachment child
parents, particular child mother, right brain-isms, will, left
brain-isms attachment, get played forms attachment
adults. like talk work briefly now, think really points
number important features establish bonds different routes
establishing bonds. within field psychoanalysis, longstanding
discussion, course, so-called unconscious subconscious, things
not aware of. think growing evidence pointing fact least
one major component subconscious unconscious so-called
autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system portion nervous

early infant-parent, particular infant-mother attachment involves coordination
synchronization right brain circuits left brain circuits, relate,
excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed
yourself, can't warm yourself, can't change yourself, certainly can't
emulate walk anywhere get things need. functions,
needs rather met primary caretaker. Typically mother.
Fathers course play role also, breastfeeding even bottle feeding,
typically mothers play prominent role. realized exceptions,
general rule. now brain imaging studies examining brains infants

emotional autonomic system, conscious detection. Now, get
older, another system starts come play parent-child interactions,
also comes play sibling interactions forth, left brain

rationality, autonomic versus conscious forms bonding.
left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side
brain emotional side rational, rather two things
happening parallel. bit dominance left brain circuitry
involved kinds bonding associated prediction reward.
good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,
predictable sort interaction. okay, come books, usually

million different, infinite number examples here, idea
two parallel circuits important establishing bonds,
set early childhood. neither emotional rational, both.
Now circuits tap circuitry talked earlier,

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic

synchronization more, guess call rational predictive
type circuits. can leverage information, can start think sorts
bonds us feel enriching complete. know can have,
instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive

unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible
well-being, like parent infant, lost appetite weeks
house training seem lose ability process cognitive
information. Now also sleep deprived, entirely focused autonomic
bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense

except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see
experience something way mental level, emotional empathy idea
yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve
emotional empathy, autonomic function cognitive empathy, mutual

able make predictions going do. also clear based
emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional
empathy cognitive empathy required order establish call

experiments tend use real money, actually something stake,
can less predict whether not somebody feels lot trust somebody

important think synchronization bodily states, talked
earlier, synchronization cognitive states. Now doesn't mean
agree everything. fact, oftentimes people feel close one another

involved social recognition. right, see people consider

worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved

milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical

breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear

beautiful study published Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal,
excellent journal. title paper Conscious Processing Narrative Stimuli
Synchronizes Heart Rate Individuals. mentioned previous podcast,
like mention go little bit depth points
specific actionable items can use order enhance quality depth
social bonds kinds. Now study involved simple type experiment,
people listen story, everybody study listened story,
listened story different times indeed different locations. different
people, story. measured things like heart rate, measured breathing,
et cetera. Now, motivation this? Well, long standing
literature showing physiology, things like heart rate, breathing, skin
conductance, meaning amount sweating, can synchronized
individuals, synchronization can occur according variety different things.
There've studies people look one another look actually
see pupil size eyes starts synchronize. People's breathing can
synchronize, people's body temperatures can even start synchronize, least shifts
body temperature can synchronize. One person gets cooler, person gets
cooler. lot subconscious, can detected conscious cues like
flushing skin, actually seeing someone's pupils change. actually pupil
reflex really good example, whereby except rare cases certain highly trained


individuals, people can't control pupil reflexes deliberate way,
truly reflex, autonomic reflex. lot literature showing within
small groups two people, physiological signals can synchronized.
study found people listen story, different times,
heart rates start synchronize. incredible people listening
story different times, gaps heartbeats become stereotype
map almost precisely onto one another. incredible. Now also know
extensive literature quality perceived depth social bond correlates
strongly much physiological synchronization individuals.
words, bodies feel same, tend feel bonded
somebody else. whole thing rather circular argument, feel
closer somebody else, physiology synchronize, reverse true well,
physiologies synchronized, feel closer people.
call concert phenomenon, ever go see favorite band, go
concert particularly love, often look somebody see
enjoying thing, often similar state are, maybe sort
like favorite song comes on, actually feel connected person. feel

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits
already established. However, early episode, mentioned
neural circuits responsible social bonding adult forms attachment,
romantic friendship otherwise actually established development. One
important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult
attachment, comes us work Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N,
Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E psychoanalyst also deep understanding
neurobiology attachment, childhood adulthood. focused lot
differences right brain left brain forms attachment. Now early
episode Huberman Lab Podcast, touched fact
discussed general public sort pop psychology even neurobiology
courses right brain versus left brain, one side brain
emotional, side rational completely wrong. Okay,
see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side
brain emotional, side brain rational just simply not true.
However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left
brain right brain, underlies certain forms attachment child
parents, particular child mother, right brain-isms, will, left
brain-isms attachment, get played forms attachment
adults. like talk work briefly now, think really points
number important features establish bonds different routes
establishing bonds. within field psychoanalysis, longstanding
discussion, course, so-called unconscious subconscious, things
not aware of. think growing evidence pointing fact least
one major component subconscious unconscious so-called
autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system portion nervous
system controls reflexive breathing, heart rate, skin conductance,
meaning sweating, pupil size, aspect nervous system makes us
alert calm. so-called sympathetic, meaning alertness,
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic
calming responses. Now Dr. Schore's work work others now showing,
early infant-parent, particular infant-mother attachment involves coordination
synchronization right brain circuits left brain circuits, relate,
excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed
yourself, can't warm yourself, can't change yourself, certainly can't
emulate walk anywhere get things need. functions,
needs rather met primary caretaker. Typically mother.
Fathers course play role also, breastfeeding even bottle feeding,
typically mothers play prominent role. realized exceptions,
general rule. now brain imaging studies examining brains infants

two, breathing mother child, heart rate mother
child, indeed pupil size mother child actually actively getting
coordinated. words, mother regulating infant's autonomic nervous
system primarily, infant also regulating mother's autonomic nervous


system, small coup baby cry, stress cry baby will
definitely regulate autonomic nervous system mother. whole right brain
system directly tapped so-called oxytocin system, talk
oxytocin moment. Oxytocin again, peptide hormone involved
social bonds kinds, least early childhood closely associated

can evoke amount oxytocin release mother. Now, however,
examples just holding child will evoke oxytocin release non-

release occurring child mother. right brain system
emotional autonomic system, conscious detection. Now, get
older, another system starts come play parent-child interactions,
also comes play sibling interactions forth, left brain
system described Allan Schore. Now, again, isn't emotion versus
rationality, autonomic versus conscious forms bonding.
left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side
brain emotional side rational, rather two things
happening parallel. bit dominance left brain circuitry
involved kinds bonding associated prediction reward.
good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,
predictable sort interaction. okay, come books, usually
bath, pajamas, lights go down, comes


book, interaction parent child, course usually
also involves physical contact. not like right brain system left brain

carries children get older parents take evolve parenting

enjoying common experience meal together. course, children get
older, able access cognitively sophisticated things. can
watch movie make predictions characters going
show instance, can take concert can appreciate
concert play concert, appreciate appreciated. Okay,
million different, infinite number examples here, idea
two parallel circuits important establishing bonds,
set early childhood. neither emotional rational, both.
Now circuits tap circuitry talked earlier,
dopamine released molecules like serotonin, neuromodulator
associated feelings warmth, comfort, satisfaction immediate
surroundings possessions rather seeking things motivation drive
go look things, case dopamine. still interactions

circuits underlie autonomic bonding, matching heart rate breathing,
neural circuits underlie bonding synchronization

clear healthy child-parent bonds established, not one
right brainer left brain systems, both.

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic
partners, important synchronization physiology
synchronization more, guess call rational predictive
type circuits. can leverage information, can start think sorts
bonds us feel enriching complete. know can have,
instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive
connection to. good example connection bulldog,
unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible
well-being, like parent infant, lost appetite weeks
house training seem lose ability process cognitive
information. Now also sleep deprived, entirely focused autonomic
bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

walk everything him, wonderful relationship. Now
clear talking form empathy. Empathy ability
feel, least think feel others feel. again, colleague
great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense
sensing people sensing, okay. no real way verify
except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see
experience something way mental level, emotional empathy idea
yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve
emotional empathy, autonomic function cognitive empathy, mutual
understanding person feels person thinks order
able make predictions going do. also clear based
emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional
empathy cognitive empathy required order establish call
trusting social bond. beautiful experiments done using neuroimaging
two individuals playing trust game, essentially game trying predict
person's behavior, whether not will behave trustworthy way.
experiments tend use real money, actually something stake,
can less predict whether not somebody feels lot trust somebody
else whether not believe will act trustworthy manner based
whether not high levels cognitive empathy emotional empathy.
seeking establish deeper bonds bonds kind,
important think synchronization bodily states, talked
earlier, synchronization cognitive states. Now doesn't mean
agree everything. fact, oftentimes people feel close one another
cognitively emotionally argue sorts things disagree lot

arguing, interesting phenotype itself. point isn't there'd
total convergence opinion stance, rather understand

going lots different effects. indeed does. Oxytocin involved orgasm,
involved social recognition. right, see people consider
people, team, group, friends, oxytocin released. Even don't
come physical contact them. Oxytocin also associated pair bonding,
feeling person, person, common language
people use. also associated honesty. Believe not, experiments
show people receive oxytocin inhalation spray, will
honest forthcoming certain things. oxytocin system variants
oxytocin system also associated autism various autism

different things. However, consistent effects oxytocin
worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved
milk, let reflex, lactation. makes perfect sense, needs cue
suckling nipple infant causes release let milk,
milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical
dilation allow baby pass birth canal. involved induction
breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear
females, sexual orgasm cause release oxytocin, whereas males,
sexual stimulation not cause release oxytocin, rather different molecule
vasopressin triggered sexual stimulation, orgasm trigger release


oxytocin males, delay 30 minutes. specific

things packaged oxytocin system. not just one way system. Now,
lot people written asking inhaling oxytocin, asking whether

beautiful study published Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal,
excellent journal. title paper Conscious Processing Narrative Stimuli
Synchronizes Heart Rate Individuals. mentioned previous podcast,
like mention go little bit depth points
specific actionable items can use order enhance quality depth
social bonds kinds. Now study involved simple type experiment,
people listen story, everybody study listened story,
listened story different times indeed different locations. different
people, story. measured things like heart rate, measured breathing,
et cetera. Now, motivation this? Well, long standing
literature showing physiology, things like heart rate, breathing, skin
conductance, meaning amount sweating, can synchronized
individuals, synchronization can occur according variety different things.
There've studies people look one another look actually
see pupil size eyes starts synchronize. People's breathing can
synchronize, people's body temperatures can even start synchronize, least shifts
body temperature can synchronize. One person gets cooler, person gets
cooler. lot subconscious, can detected conscious cues like
flushing skin, actually seeing someone's pupils change. actually pupil

individuals, people can't control pupil reflexes deliberate way,
truly reflex, autonomic reflex. lot literature showing within
small groups two people, physiological signals can synchronized.
study found people listen story, different times,
heart rates start synchronize. incredible people listening

physiologies synchronized, feel closer people.
call concert phenomenon, ever go see favorite band, go

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits
already established. However, early episode, mentioned
neural circuits responsible social bonding adult forms attachment,
romantic friendship otherwise actually established development. One
important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult
attachment, comes us work Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N,
Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E psychoanalyst also deep understanding
neurobiology attachment, childhood adulthood. focused lot
differences right brain left brain forms attachment. Now early
episode Huberman Lab Podcast, touched fact
discussed general public sort pop psychology even neurobiology
courses right brain versus left brain, one side brain
emotional, side rational completely wrong. Okay,
see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side
brain emotional, side brain rational just simply not true.
However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left
brain right brain, underlies certain forms attachment child
parents, particular child mother, right brain-isms, will, left
brain-isms attachment, get played forms attachment
adults. like talk work briefly now, think really points
number important features establish bonds different routes
establishing bonds. within field psychoanalysis, longstanding
discussion, course, so-called unconscious subconscious, things
not aware of. think growing evidence pointing fact least
one major component subconscious unconscious so-called
autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system portion nervous
system controls reflexive breathing, heart rate, skin conductance,
meaning sweating, pupil size, aspect nervous system makes us
alert calm. so-called sympathetic, meaning alertness,
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic
calming responses. Now Dr. Schore's work work others now showing,
early infant-parent, particular infant-mother attachment involves coordination
synchronization right brain circuits left brain circuits, relate,
excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed
yourself, can't warm yourself, can't change yourself, certainly can't
emulate walk anywhere get things need. functions,
needs rather met primary caretaker. Typically mother.
Fathers course play role also, breastfeeding even bottle feeding,
typically mothers play prominent role. realized exceptions,
general rule. now brain imaging studies examining brains infants
brains mothers interact showing physical contact
two, breathing mother child, heart rate mother
child, indeed pupil size mother child actually actively getting
coordinated. words, mother regulating infant's autonomic nervous
system primarily, infant also regulating mother's autonomic nervous


system, small coup baby cry, stress cry baby will
definitely regulate autonomic nervous system mother. whole right brain
system directly tapped so-called oxytocin system, talk
oxytocin moment. Oxytocin again, peptide hormone involved
social bonds kinds, least early childhood closely associated

can evoke amount oxytocin release mother. Now, however,
examples just holding child will evoke oxytocin release non-

emotional autonomic system, conscious detection. Now, get
older, another system starts come play parent-child interactions,
also comes play sibling interactions forth, left brain
system described Allan Schore. Now, again, isn't emotion versus
rationality, autonomic versus conscious forms bonding.
left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side
brain emotional side rational, rather two things
happening parallel. bit dominance left brain circuitry
involved kinds bonding associated prediction reward.
good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,
predictable sort interaction. okay, come books, usually
bath, pajamas, lights go down, comes


book, interaction parent child, course usually
also involves physical contact. not like right brain system left brain

carries children get older parents take evolve parenting

older, able access cognitively sophisticated things. can
watch movie make predictions characters going
show instance, can take concert can appreciate
concert play concert, appreciate appreciated. Okay,
million different, infinite number examples here, idea
two parallel circuits important establishing bonds,
set early childhood. neither emotional rational, both.
Now circuits tap circuitry talked earlier,
dopamine released molecules like serotonin, neuromodulator
associated feelings warmth, comfort, satisfaction immediate
surroundings possessions rather seeking things motivation drive
go look things, case dopamine. still interactions

clear healthy child-parent bonds established, not one
right brainer left brain systems, both.

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic
partners, important synchronization physiology
synchronization more, guess call rational predictive
type circuits. can leverage information, can start think sorts
bonds us feel enriching complete. know can have,
instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive
connection to. good example connection bulldog,
unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible
well-being, like parent infant, lost appetite weeks
house training seem lose ability process cognitive
information. Now also sleep deprived, entirely focused autonomic
bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

walk everything him, wonderful relationship. Now
clear talking form empathy. Empathy ability
feel, least think feel others feel. again, colleague
great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense
sensing people sensing, okay. no real way verify
except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see
experience something way mental level, emotional empathy idea
yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve
emotional empathy, autonomic function cognitive empathy, mutual
understanding person feels person thinks order
able make predictions going do. also clear based
emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional
empathy cognitive empathy required order establish call
trusting social bond. beautiful experiments done using neuroimaging
two individuals playing trust game, essentially game trying predict
person's behavior, whether not will behave trustworthy way.
experiments tend use real money, actually something stake,
can less predict whether not somebody feels lot trust somebody
else whether not believe will act trustworthy manner based
whether not high levels cognitive empathy emotional empathy.
seeking establish deeper bonds bonds kind,
important think synchronization bodily states, talked
earlier, synchronization cognitive states. Now doesn't mean
agree everything. fact, oftentimes people feel close one another
cognitively emotionally argue sorts things disagree lot

involved social recognition. right, see people consider
people, team, group, friends, oxytocin released. Even don't

worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved

milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical

breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can

body temperature can synchronize. One person gets cooler, person gets
cooler. lot subconscious, can detected conscious cues like
flushing skin, actually seeing someone's pupils change. actually pupil

many types social interactions, not direct interaction person
makes us feel close them, rather shared experience. shared experience

sometimes can useful rather expecting others shift physiology

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits
already established. However, early episode, mentioned
neural circuits responsible social bonding adult forms attachment,
romantic friendship otherwise actually established development. One
important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult
attachment, comes us work Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N,
Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E psychoanalyst also deep understanding
neurobiology attachment, childhood adulthood. focused lot
differences right brain left brain forms attachment. Now early
episode Huberman Lab Podcast, touched fact
discussed general public sort pop psychology even neurobiology
courses right brain versus left brain, one side brain
emotional, side rational completely wrong. Okay,
see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side
brain emotional, side brain rational just simply not true.
However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left
brain right brain, underlies certain forms attachment child
parents, particular child mother, right brain-isms, will, left
brain-isms attachment, get played forms attachment
adults. like talk work briefly now, think really points
number important features establish bonds different routes
establishing bonds. within field psychoanalysis, longstanding
discussion, course, so-called unconscious subconscious, things
not aware of. think growing evidence pointing fact least
one major component subconscious unconscious so-called
autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system portion nervous
system controls reflexive breathing, heart rate, skin conductance,
meaning sweating, pupil size, aspect nervous system makes us
alert calm. so-called sympathetic, meaning alertness,
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic
calming responses. Now Dr. Schore's work work others now showing,
early infant-parent, particular infant-mother attachment involves coordination
synchronization right brain circuits left brain circuits, relate,
excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed
yourself, can't warm yourself, can't change yourself, certainly can't
emulate walk anywhere get things need. functions,
needs rather met primary caretaker. Typically mother.
Fathers course play role also, breastfeeding even bottle feeding,
typically mothers play prominent role. realized exceptions,
general rule. now brain imaging studies examining brains infants
brains mothers interact showing physical contact
two, breathing mother child, heart rate mother
child, indeed pupil size mother child actually actively getting
coordinated. words, mother regulating infant's autonomic nervous
system primarily, infant also regulating mother's autonomic nervous


system, small coup baby cry, stress cry baby will
definitely regulate autonomic nervous system mother. whole right brain
system directly tapped so-called oxytocin system, talk
oxytocin moment. Oxytocin again, peptide hormone involved
social bonds kinds, least early childhood closely associated

examples just holding child will evoke oxytocin release non-

release occurring child mother. right brain system
emotional autonomic system, conscious detection. Now, get
older, another system starts come play parent-child interactions,
also comes play sibling interactions forth, left brain
system described Allan Schore. Now, again, isn't emotion versus
rationality, autonomic versus conscious forms bonding.
left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side
brain emotional side rational, rather two things
happening parallel. bit dominance left brain circuitry
involved kinds bonding associated prediction reward.
good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,
predictable sort interaction. okay, come books, usually
bath, pajamas, lights go down, comes


book, interaction parent child, course usually
also involves physical contact. not like right brain system left brain
system operating separately, operating parallel. sort prediction
reward kids like read to, generally mediated left brain system.
carries children get older parents take evolve parenting

relies fact right brain system left brain system engaged,
synchronization autonomic function, meaning joining together actual
somatic feeling, synchronization experience
outward external stimulus, like reading book watching show together
enjoying common experience meal together. course, children get
older, able access cognitively sophisticated things. can
watch movie make predictions characters going
show instance, can take concert can appreciate
concert play concert, appreciate appreciated. Okay,
million different, infinite number examples here, idea
two parallel circuits important establishing bonds,
set early childhood. neither emotional rational, both.
Now circuits tap circuitry talked earlier,
dopamine released molecules like serotonin, neuromodulator
associated feelings warmth, comfort, satisfaction immediate
surroundings possessions rather seeking things motivation drive
go look things, case dopamine. still interactions

circuits underlie autonomic bonding, matching heart rate breathing,
neural circuits underlie bonding synchronization

clear healthy child-parent bonds established, not one
right brainer left brain systems, both.

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic
partners, important synchronization physiology
synchronization more, guess call rational predictive
type circuits. can leverage information, can start think sorts

instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive
connection to. good example connection bulldog,
unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible
well-being, like parent infant, lost appetite weeks
house training seem lose ability process cognitive
information. Now also sleep deprived, entirely focused autonomic
bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense

except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see
experience something way mental level, emotional empathy idea
yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve
emotional empathy, autonomic function cognitive empathy, mutual

able make predictions going do. also clear based
emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional
empathy cognitive empathy required order establish call

experiments tend use real money, actually something stake,
can less predict whether not somebody feels lot trust somebody

important think synchronization bodily states, talked
earlier, synchronization cognitive states. Now doesn't mean
agree everything. fact, oftentimes people feel close one another
cognitively emotionally argue sorts things disagree lot

going lots different effects. indeed does. Oxytocin involved orgasm,
involved social recognition. right, see people consider
people, team, group, friends, oxytocin released. Even don't
come physical contact them. Oxytocin also associated pair bonding,
feeling person, person, common language
people use. also associated honesty. Believe not, experiments
show people receive oxytocin inhalation spray, will
honest forthcoming certain things. oxytocin system variants
oxytocin system also associated autism various autism

different things. However, consistent effects oxytocin
worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved
milk, let reflex, lactation. makes perfect sense, needs cue
suckling nipple infant causes release let milk,
milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical
dilation allow baby pass birth canal. involved induction
breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear
females, sexual orgasm cause release oxytocin, whereas males,
sexual stimulation not cause release oxytocin, rather different molecule
vasopressin triggered sexual stimulation, orgasm trigger release


oxytocin males, delay 30 minutes. specific
function not clear, seem oxytocin involved sexual

amplitude oxytocin released tends scale closely associated individuals
just sight one's baby smell one's baby can evoke oxytocin release vice
versa mother. Physical contact, even romantic partners. Physical
contact, even sight picture partner can evoke oxytocin release sexual
desire also trust. whole collection psychological physiological
things packaged oxytocin system. not just one way system. Now,
lot people written asking inhaling oxytocin, asking whether
not can actually increase depth rate pair bonding. seem
evidence that. Now, think places, oxytocin prescription,

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits
already established. However, early episode, mentioned
neural circuits responsible social bonding adult forms attachment,
romantic friendship otherwise actually established development. One
important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult
attachment, comes us work Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N,
Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E psychoanalyst also deep understanding
neurobiology attachment, childhood adulthood. focused lot
differences right brain left brain forms attachment. Now early
episode Huberman Lab Podcast, touched fact
discussed general public sort pop psychology even neurobiology
courses right brain versus left brain, one side brain
emotional, side rational completely wrong. Okay,
see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side
brain emotional, side brain rational just simply not true.
However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left
brain right brain, underlies certain forms attachment child
parents, particular child mother, right brain-isms, will, left
brain-isms attachment, get played forms attachment
adults. like talk work briefly now, think really points
number important features establish bonds different routes
establishing bonds. within field psychoanalysis, longstanding
discussion, course, so-called unconscious subconscious, things
not aware of. think growing evidence pointing fact least
one major component subconscious unconscious so-called
autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system portion nervous
system controls reflexive breathing, heart rate, skin conductance,
meaning sweating, pupil size, aspect nervous system makes us
alert calm. so-called sympathetic, meaning alertness,
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic
calming responses. Now Dr. Schore's work work others now showing,
early infant-parent, particular infant-mother attachment involves coordination
synchronization right brain circuits left brain circuits, relate,
excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed
yourself, can't warm yourself, can't change yourself, certainly can't
emulate walk anywhere get things need. functions,
needs rather met primary caretaker. Typically mother.
Fathers course play role also, breastfeeding even bottle feeding,
typically mothers play prominent role. realized exceptions,
general rule. now brain imaging studies examining brains infants
brains mothers interact showing physical contact
two, breathing mother child, heart rate mother
child, indeed pupil size mother child actually actively getting
coordinated. words, mother regulating infant's autonomic nervous
system primarily, infant also regulating mother's autonomic nervous


system, small coup baby cry, stress cry baby will
definitely regulate autonomic nervous system mother. whole right brain
system directly tapped so-called oxytocin system, talk
oxytocin moment. Oxytocin again, peptide hormone involved
social bonds kinds, least early childhood closely associated
milk let milk production. actually lot stimulation oxytocin
release mother nursing itself, physical contact nipple,
contact skin baby mother specificity there, not just baby
can evoke amount oxytocin release mother. Now, however,
examples just holding child will evoke oxytocin release non-
parent somebody parent, think people experience that.
new puppy new baby phenomenon 'cause indeed puppies can invoke oxytocin
release well. point not oxytocin released response primary
relationship, mother child, rather amount oxytocin scales
closely related one particular child vice versa. oxytocin
release occurring child mother. right brain system
emotional autonomic system, conscious detection. Now, get
older, another system starts come play parent-child interactions,
also comes play sibling interactions forth, left brain
system described Allan Schore. Now, again, isn't emotion versus
rationality, autonomic versus conscious forms bonding.
left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side
brain emotional side rational, rather two things
happening parallel. bit dominance left brain circuitry
involved kinds bonding associated prediction reward.
good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,
predictable sort interaction. okay, come books, usually
bath, pajamas, lights go down, comes


book, interaction parent child, course usually
also involves physical contact. not like right brain system left brain
system operating separately, operating parallel. sort prediction
reward kids like read to, generally mediated left brain system.
carries children get older parents take evolve parenting
roles. apparent healthy social bonding children caretaker
relies fact right brain system left brain system engaged,
synchronization autonomic function, meaning joining together actual
somatic feeling, synchronization experience
outward external stimulus, like reading book watching show together
enjoying common experience meal together. course, children get
older, able access cognitively sophisticated things. can
watch movie make predictions characters going
show instance, can take concert can appreciate
concert play concert, appreciate appreciated. Okay,
million different, infinite number examples here, idea
two parallel circuits important establishing bonds,
set early childhood. neither emotional rational, both.
Now circuits tap circuitry talked earlier,
dopamine released molecules like serotonin, neuromodulator
associated feelings warmth, comfort, satisfaction immediate
surroundings possessions rather seeking things motivation drive
go look things, case dopamine. still interactions
systems, work Allan Schore stimulated lot interest
circuits underlie autonomic bonding, matching heart rate breathing,
neural circuits underlie bonding synchronization
experience kind left brain side. reason find model attractive
clear healthy child-parent bonds established, not one
right brainer left brain systems, both.

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic
partners, important synchronization physiology
synchronization more, guess call rational predictive
type circuits. can leverage information, can start think sorts
bonds us feel enriching complete. know can have,
instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive
connection to. good example connection bulldog,
unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible
well-being, like parent infant, lost appetite weeks
house training seem lose ability process cognitive
information. Now also sleep deprived, entirely focused autonomic
bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

walk everything him, wonderful relationship. Now
clear talking form empathy. Empathy ability
feel, least think feel others feel. again, colleague
great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense
sensing people sensing, okay. no real way verify
except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see
experience something way mental level, emotional empathy idea
yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve
emotional empathy, autonomic function cognitive empathy, mutual
understanding person feels person thinks order
able make predictions going do. also clear based
emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional
empathy cognitive empathy required order establish call
trusting social bond. beautiful experiments done using neuroimaging
two individuals playing trust game, essentially game trying predict
person's behavior, whether not will behave trustworthy way.
experiments tend use real money, actually something stake,
can less predict whether not somebody feels lot trust somebody
else whether not believe will act trustworthy manner based
whether not high levels cognitive empathy emotional empathy.
seeking establish deeper bonds bonds kind,
important think synchronization bodily states, talked
earlier, synchronization cognitive states. Now doesn't mean
agree everything. fact, oftentimes people feel close one another
cognitively emotionally argue sorts things disagree lot
things. fact, probably know, certainly know people couples seem bond
arguing, interesting phenotype itself. point isn't there'd
total convergence opinion stance, rather understand

worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved

suckling nipple infant causes release let milk,
milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical
dilation allow baby pass birth canal. involved induction
breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear
females, sexual orgasm cause release oxytocin, whereas males,
sexual stimulation not cause release oxytocin, rather different molecule

oxytocin males, delay 30 minutes. specific

lot people written asking inhaling oxytocin, asking whether

milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical

breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say

now, talking social bonding lens neurocircuits
already established. However, early episode, mentioned
neural circuits responsible social bonding adult forms attachment,
romantic friendship otherwise actually established development. One
important, think exciting areas early attachment relates adult
attachment, comes us work Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N,
Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E psychoanalyst also deep understanding
neurobiology attachment, childhood adulthood. focused lot
differences right brain left brain forms attachment. Now early
episode Huberman Lab Podcast, touched fact
discussed general public sort pop psychology even neurobiology
courses right brain versus left brain, one side brain
emotional, side rational completely wrong. Okay,
see actually backwards way things actually work.
some, call lateralization function, meaning certain brain functions


handled neurons one side brain other, idea one side
brain emotional, side brain rational just simply not true.
However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits
lateralization bias, meaning right brain left brain, left
brain right brain, underlies certain forms attachment child
parents, particular child mother, right brain-isms, will, left
brain-isms attachment, get played forms attachment
adults. like talk work briefly now, think really points
number important features establish bonds different routes
establishing bonds. within field psychoanalysis, longstanding
discussion, course, so-called unconscious subconscious, things
not aware of. think growing evidence pointing fact least
one major component subconscious unconscious so-called
autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system portion nervous
system controls reflexive breathing, heart rate, skin conductance,
meaning sweating, pupil size, aspect nervous system makes us
alert calm. so-called sympathetic, meaning alertness,
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic
calming responses. Now Dr. Schore's work work others now showing,
early infant-parent, particular infant-mother attachment involves coordination
synchronization right brain circuits left brain circuits, relate,
excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed
yourself, can't warm yourself, can't change yourself, certainly can't
emulate walk anywhere get things need. functions,
needs rather met primary caretaker. Typically mother.
Fathers course play role also, breastfeeding even bottle feeding,
typically mothers play prominent role. realized exceptions,
general rule. now brain imaging studies examining brains infants

can evoke amount oxytocin release mother. Now, however,
examples just holding child will evoke oxytocin release non-

release occurring child mother. right brain system
emotional autonomic system, conscious detection. Now, get
older, another system starts come play parent-child interactions,
also comes play sibling interactions forth, left brain
system described Allan Schore. Now, again, isn't emotion versus
rationality, autonomic versus conscious forms bonding.
left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side
brain emotional side rational, rather two things
happening parallel. bit dominance left brain circuitry
involved kinds bonding associated prediction reward.
good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,
predictable sort interaction. okay, come books, usually
bath, pajamas, lights go down, comes


book, interaction parent child, course usually
also involves physical contact. not like right brain system left brain
system operating separately, operating parallel. sort prediction
reward kids like read to, generally mediated left brain system.
carries children get older parents take evolve parenting
roles. apparent healthy social bonding children caretaker
relies fact right brain system left brain system engaged,
synchronization autonomic function, meaning joining together actual
somatic feeling, synchronization experience
outward external stimulus, like reading book watching show together
enjoying common experience meal together. course, children get
older, able access cognitively sophisticated things. can
watch movie make predictions characters going
show instance, can take concert can appreciate
concert play concert, appreciate appreciated. Okay,
million different, infinite number examples here, idea
two parallel circuits important establishing bonds,
set early childhood. neither emotional rational, both.
Now circuits tap circuitry talked earlier,
dopamine released molecules like serotonin, neuromodulator
associated feelings warmth, comfort, satisfaction immediate
surroundings possessions rather seeking things motivation drive
go look things, case dopamine. still interactions
systems, work Allan Schore stimulated lot interest
circuits underlie autonomic bonding, matching heart rate breathing,
neural circuits underlie bonding synchronization
experience kind left brain side. reason find model attractive
clear healthy child-parent bonds established, not one
right brainer left brain systems, both.

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic
partners, important synchronization physiology
synchronization more, guess call rational predictive
type circuits. can leverage information, can start think sorts
bonds us feel enriching complete. know can have,
instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive
connection to. good example connection bulldog,
unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible
well-being, like parent infant, lost appetite weeks
house training seem lose ability process cognitive
information. Now also sleep deprived, entirely focused autonomic
bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

walk everything him, wonderful relationship. Now
clear talking form empathy. Empathy ability
feel, least think feel others feel. again, colleague
great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense
sensing people sensing, okay. no real way verify
except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see
experience something way mental level, emotional empathy idea
yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve
emotional empathy, autonomic function cognitive empathy, mutual
understanding person feels person thinks order
able make predictions going do. also clear based
emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional
empathy cognitive empathy required order establish call
trusting social bond. beautiful experiments done using neuroimaging
two individuals playing trust game, essentially game trying predict
person's behavior, whether not will behave trustworthy way.
experiments tend use real money, actually something stake,
can less predict whether not somebody feels lot trust somebody
else whether not believe will act trustworthy manner based
whether not high levels cognitive empathy emotional empathy.
seeking establish deeper bonds bonds kind,
important think synchronization bodily states, talked
earlier, synchronization cognitive states. Now doesn't mean
agree everything. fact, oftentimes people feel close one another
cognitively emotionally argue sorts things disagree lot
things. fact, probably know, certainly know people couples seem bond
arguing, interesting phenotype itself. point isn't there'd
total convergence opinion stance, rather understand

going lots different effects. indeed does. Oxytocin involved orgasm,
involved social recognition. right, see people consider
people, team, group, friends, oxytocin released. Even don't
come physical contact them. Oxytocin also associated pair bonding,
feeling person, person, common language
people use. also associated honesty. Believe not, experiments

different things. However, consistent effects oxytocin
worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved
milk, let reflex, lactation. makes perfect sense, needs cue
suckling nipple infant causes release let milk,
milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical
dilation allow baby pass birth canal. involved induction
breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear
females, sexual orgasm cause release oxytocin, whereas males,
sexual stimulation not cause release oxytocin, rather different molecule
vasopressin triggered sexual stimulation, orgasm trigger release


oxytocin males, delay 30 minutes. specific
function not clear, seem oxytocin involved sexual
response males females. main types interactions release
oxytocin high levels first all, interaction individuals see
closely associated, right? infant mother closely
associated whether not adopted infant not. Oftentimes close
contact, oftentimes body other. amount
amplitude oxytocin released tends scale closely associated individuals
just sight one's baby smell one's baby can evoke oxytocin release vice
versa mother. Physical contact, even romantic partners. Physical
contact, even sight picture partner can evoke oxytocin release sexual
desire also trust. whole collection psychological physiological
things packaged oxytocin system. not just one way system. Now,
lot people written asking inhaling oxytocin, asking whether
not can actually increase depth rate pair bonding. seem
evidence that. Now, think places, oxytocin prescription,
although might over-the-counter others, don't know, check

However, work Allan Schore points concrete neural circuits

excuse me, autonomic nervous system. play out? Well, plays
early infant, born, truly helpless, can't feed
yourself, can't warm yourself, can't change yourself, certainly can't
emulate walk anywhere get things need. functions,
needs rather met primary caretaker. Typically mother.
Fathers course play role also, breastfeeding even bottle feeding,
typically mothers play prominent role. realized exceptions,

oxytocin moment. Oxytocin again, peptide hormone involved
social bonds kinds, least early childhood closely associated

rationality, autonomic versus conscious forms bonding.
left brain circuit side, evidence based neuroimaging studies, also
animal studies support idea left brain side things,
processing narratives concrete, logical narratives, okay. again,
zoom just really tamped idea not one side
brain emotional side rational, rather two things
happening parallel. bit dominance left brain circuitry
involved kinds bonding associated prediction reward.
good example reading child every night, sitting reading,
know, can recall reading niece seeing parents read her.
no clue whatsoever saying she, well, least, don't know,
certainly couldn't speak, liked looking pictures,
predictable sort interaction. okay, come books, usually
bath, pajamas, lights go down, comes


book, interaction parent child, course usually
also involves physical contact. not like right brain system left brain

million different, infinite number examples here, idea
two parallel circuits important establishing bonds,
set early childhood. neither emotional rational, both.
Now circuits tap circuitry talked earlier,
dopamine released molecules like serotonin, neuromodulator

right brainer left brain systems, both.

01:03:45 Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment

isn't enough time go right now, probably familiar
idea anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus kind


dissociative attached model infant parent bonding, just briefly. becoming clear
neuro-biological imaging studies people start advance
adolescence adulthood well elderly years, circuits
active established childhood repurposed forms attachment.
truly complete bonds individuals, particular romantic
partners, important synchronization physiology
synchronization more, guess call rational predictive
type circuits. can leverage information, can start think sorts
bonds us feel enriching complete. know can have,
instance, emotional connection somebody, can also cognitive
connection somebody. many colleagues deep intellectual
connection convergence with. won't say deep emotional connection
them, them, yes, no. Others life,
instance, deep emotional connection to, not lot deep cognitive
connection to. good example connection bulldog,
unfortunately passed away. Costello, close, emotional connection,
right? based touch, based walks, based fun,
autonomic. rarely discussed ever doing, felt relationship
opposed cognitive relationship. sort half kidding that,
example, really good example, real bond. fact, just brief
anecdote, can remember Costello puppy entirely responsible
well-being, like parent infant, lost appetite weeks
house training seem lose ability process cognitive
information. Now also sleep deprived, entirely focused autonomic
bond forming. now, thankfully, eventually established pretty
quickly. Basically went just basically feed him,

01:06:10 Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing

walk everything him, wonderful relationship. Now
clear talking form empathy. Empathy ability
feel, least think feel others feel. again, colleague
great bioengineer psychiatrist Stanford, Karl Deisseroth said,
guest podcast. really don't know people feel, just get sense


perhaps feeling thing feeling something different
infer, project might thinking. Empathy sense
sensing people sensing, okay. no real way verify
except measuring physiologies, get insight that.
clinical psychology neuro-biological literature now, understood
emotional empathy, like actually feeling somebody feeling now
called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy idea see
experience something way mental level, emotional empathy idea
yes, can feel feel visceral sematic autonomic level.
absolutely clear strong social bonds children caretaker involve
emotional empathy, autonomic function cognitive empathy, mutual
understanding person feels person thinks order
able make predictions going do. also clear based
emerging literature, romantic relationships, extent, friendships,
although friendships explored bit less literature, emotional
empathy cognitive empathy required order establish call
trusting social bond. beautiful experiments done using neuroimaging
two individuals playing trust game, essentially game trying predict
person's behavior, whether not will behave trustworthy way.
experiments tend use real money, actually something stake,
can less predict whether not somebody feels lot trust somebody
else whether not believe will act trustworthy manner based
whether not high levels cognitive empathy emotional empathy.
seeking establish deeper bonds bonds kind,
important think synchronization bodily states, talked
earlier, synchronization cognitive states. Now doesn't mean
agree everything. fact, oftentimes people feel close one another
cognitively emotionally argue sorts things disagree lot

01:10:40 Oxytocin & Trust, Males Versus Females, Hormonal Glue

or, know, Allan Schore, love get podcast. One key themes
understand biological processes often work short timescales
longer timescales. now, mainly talking stuff
happens short timescales. kind synchronization heart rate activation
given set neurons dumps dopamine causes us seek
social interaction less instance. every biological circuit function needs
longstanding effects well. typically thinking longstanding
effects brain body, start looking towards hormone system. not
always case, often not neuro-transmitters neuromodulators
pretty quick, whereas hormones longer lasting effects. fact, lot hormones
can actually travel nucleus cell actually change genes


expressed. ever hormone hormone-like molecule associated
social bonding, oxytocin, oxytocin gotten ton interest popular
press. don't know is, perhaps incredible things
oxytocin associated with. indeed lot things. instance, oxytocin
released brain binds receptors different locations body,
moment hear different locations body receptors, think, well,
going lots different effects. indeed does. Oxytocin involved orgasm,
involved social recognition. right, see people consider
people, team, group, friends, oxytocin released. Even don't
come physical contact them. Oxytocin also associated pair bonding,
feeling person, person, common language
people use. also associated honesty. Believe not, experiments
show people receive oxytocin inhalation spray, will
honest forthcoming certain things. oxytocin system variants
oxytocin system also associated autism various autism
spectrum disorders. huge range behaviors involved
receptors oxytocin lots different brain structures areas body
different things. However, consistent effects oxytocin
worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved
milk, let reflex, lactation. makes perfect sense, needs cue
suckling nipple infant causes release let milk,
milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical
dilation allow baby pass birth canal. involved induction
breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear
females, sexual orgasm cause release oxytocin, whereas males,
sexual stimulation not cause release oxytocin, rather different molecule
vasopressin triggered sexual stimulation, orgasm trigger release


oxytocin males, delay 30 minutes. specific
function not clear, seem oxytocin involved sexual
response males females. main types interactions release
oxytocin high levels first all, interaction individuals see
closely associated, right? infant mother closely
associated whether not adopted infant not. Oftentimes close
contact, oftentimes body other. amount
amplitude oxytocin released tends scale closely associated individuals
just sight one's baby smell one's baby can evoke oxytocin release vice
versa mother. Physical contact, even romantic partners. Physical
contact, even sight picture partner can evoke oxytocin release sexual
desire also trust. whole collection psychological physiological
things packaged oxytocin system. not just one way system. Now,
lot people written asking inhaling oxytocin, asking whether
not can actually increase depth rate pair bonding. seem
evidence that. Now, think places, oxytocin prescription,
although might over-the-counter others, don't know, check
far know can't just go buy oxytocin nasal spray, although
may able to, forgive me, naive point. interesting note
drugs

01:16:10 Repairing Broken Bonds Self & Others

used clinical trials things like trauma, also used clinical
therapeutic settings increasing bonding, particular MDMA, also called ecstasy,
increase dopamine serotonin, know this, dopamine serotonin vast
number effects throughout brain body talked
today another podcast. one lesser appreciated effects MDMA
causes huge increases, massive increases amount oxytocin released
brain body. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy still illegal, far
know, certainly United States, places throughout world,
explored clinical trials, not just trauma, not just depression, not just eating
disorders, also reestablishing seemed fractured challenged bonds
romantic partners. attention focused


dopaminergic serotonergic aspects MDMA response, clear me, based
read literature, enormously elevated oxytocin occurs
consumption MDMA part reason people experience MDMA
session post MDMA session, much greater degree depth kinship feeling
connection person. important point feeling
connection autonomic type referring earlier, al Allan Schore's work.
not the, oh, think things exact way, agree
everything now, physiologies synchronized. much
even individuals within couple one therapeutic session
not, still feel quite bonded other. Now, oftentimes
clinical therapeutic setting, members couple romantic partnership, whatever
form may take consuming MDMA thereby experiencing elevated oxytocin
enhanced sense bonding, again, autonomic bonding,
powerful. Meaning oxytocin response powerful doesn't even require
individuals experienced user inflection oxytocin, one
person's physiology influencing other, oxytocin kind bridging signal
occurs nervous systems, synchronizes things like heartbeat, obviously
associated touch. people touching people engaging sorts
behaviors mentioned earlier, can increase oxytocin further, going
increase depth bond. point actually
hormonal glue individuals, okay, infant mother,

01:18:56 Social (Media) Butterflies: Biological Basis

friends, teammates, romantic partners, on. hormonal glue oxytocin.
Now people vary extent feel capacity feel bonded
anyone. now generally understood variation might depend
variations oxytocin receptors called gene polymorphisms oxytocin.
Genes can number different sequences them, nucleotide sequences,
won't go genetics right now, Gs Cs Ts various combinations
make genes. Genes transcribed RNA, RNA translated
proteins affect cells, okay? oxytocin gene encodes oxytocin variants
gene change amount function oxytocin. really interesting study
published just last year relatively new journal, journal kind


unusual name Heliyon, think Heliyon not hellion, Heliyon, H-E-L-I-Y-O-N.
Cell Press journal, far can tell, solid journal, certainly Cell
Press label stringent. paper entitled, Relation Oxytocin

people follow thousands accounts take ratio many accounts
people follow versus many followers have, arguably not perfect measure,
nice one sense can completely unbiased way many,
many thousands subjects. able get genomic analysis
number subjects. turns people have, say higher levels
oxytocin function potential levels oxytocin function, actively seek social
interactions social media. this, think represents important first area
social media data social media starting merge biological data
terms predicting avidly people will seek social interactions online type.
nowadays, hear lot online, connected not really...
it? communicating not connected connections aren't real.
think going need revisit that. certainly believer idea
face-to-face communication common interactions people standing

vitally important, entire generation, several generations people
coming much social interaction online. think it,
things spelled earlier common mental narrative, left-

thousand us look exact Instagram post, yes, will thousand
independent responses that, chances many us similar


response based data talked earlier synchronization
heartbeats. socially bonded people social media,
apparent oxytocin system playing role that. this,
zoom makes perfect sense, again, dopamine, serotonin, prolactin, oxytocin,
none systems placed us organized within us order
encourage specific specific types social interactions. one can
say absolutely critical child-parent interaction, right? children simply
can't take care themselves, need caretaker. said caretaker, not
parent. infants, not taken care will die. beyond that, evolved
come realize many different types social interactions, online interactions
nowadays very, common. certainly involved them, guessing
involved well, involved one right now, example. oxytocin
system absolutely threaded largely responsible types social
bonds well. incidentally, "Oxytocin" name

or, know, Allan Schore, love get podcast. One key themes
understand biological processes often work short timescales
longer timescales. now, mainly talking stuff
happens short timescales. kind synchronization heart rate activation
given set neurons dumps dopamine causes us seek
social interaction less instance. every biological circuit function needs
longstanding effects well. typically thinking longstanding

always case, often not neuro-transmitters neuromodulators
pretty quick, whereas hormones longer lasting effects. fact, lot hormones
can actually travel nucleus cell actually change genes


expressed. ever hormone hormone-like molecule associated
social bonding, oxytocin, oxytocin gotten ton interest popular
press. don't know is, perhaps incredible things
oxytocin associated with. indeed lot things. instance, oxytocin
released brain binds receptors different locations body,
moment hear different locations body receptors, think, well,
going lots different effects. indeed does. Oxytocin involved orgasm,
involved social recognition. right, see people consider
people, team, group, friends, oxytocin released. Even don't
come physical contact them. Oxytocin also associated pair bonding,
feeling person, person, common language
people use. also associated honesty. Believe not, experiments
show people receive oxytocin inhalation spray, will
honest forthcoming certain things. oxytocin system variants
oxytocin system also associated autism various autism
spectrum disorders. huge range behaviors involved
receptors oxytocin lots different brain structures areas body
different things. However, consistent effects oxytocin
worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved
milk, let reflex, lactation. makes perfect sense, needs cue
suckling nipple infant causes release let milk,
milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical
dilation allow baby pass birth canal. involved induction
breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear
females, sexual orgasm cause release oxytocin, whereas males,
sexual stimulation not cause release oxytocin, rather different molecule
vasopressin triggered sexual stimulation, orgasm trigger release


oxytocin males, delay 30 minutes. specific
function not clear, seem oxytocin involved sexual
response males females. main types interactions release
oxytocin high levels first all, interaction individuals see
closely associated, right? infant mother closely
associated whether not adopted infant not. Oftentimes close
contact, oftentimes body other. amount
amplitude oxytocin released tends scale closely associated individuals
just sight one's baby smell one's baby can evoke oxytocin release vice
versa mother. Physical contact, even romantic partners. Physical
contact, even sight picture partner can evoke oxytocin release sexual
desire also trust. whole collection psychological physiological
things packaged oxytocin system. not just one way system. Now,
lot people written asking inhaling oxytocin, asking whether
not can actually increase depth rate pair bonding. seem
evidence that. Now, think places, oxytocin prescription,
although might over-the-counter others, don't know, check
far know can't just go buy oxytocin nasal spray, although
may able to, forgive me, naive point. interesting note

01:16:10 Repairing Broken Bonds Self & Others

used clinical trials things like trauma, also used clinical
therapeutic settings increasing bonding, particular MDMA, also called ecstasy,
increase dopamine serotonin, know this, dopamine serotonin vast
number effects throughout brain body talked
today another podcast. one lesser appreciated effects MDMA
causes huge increases, massive increases amount oxytocin released
brain body. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy still illegal, far
know, certainly United States, places throughout world,
explored clinical trials, not just trauma, not just depression, not just eating
disorders, also reestablishing seemed fractured challenged bonds
romantic partners. attention focused


dopaminergic serotonergic aspects MDMA response, clear me, based
read literature, enormously elevated oxytocin occurs
consumption MDMA part reason people experience MDMA
session post MDMA session, much greater degree depth kinship feeling

connection autonomic type referring earlier, al Allan Schore's work.
not the, oh, think things exact way, agree
everything now, physiologies synchronized. much
even individuals within couple one therapeutic session
not, still feel quite bonded other. Now, oftentimes
clinical therapeutic setting, members couple romantic partnership, whatever
form may take consuming MDMA thereby experiencing elevated oxytocin
enhanced sense bonding, again, autonomic bonding,
powerful. Meaning oxytocin response powerful doesn't even require
individuals experienced user inflection oxytocin, one
person's physiology influencing other, oxytocin kind bridging signal
occurs nervous systems, synchronizes things like heartbeat, obviously
associated touch. people touching people engaging sorts
behaviors mentioned earlier, can increase oxytocin further, going
increase depth bond. point actually
hormonal glue individuals, okay, infant mother,

Now people vary extent feel capacity feel bonded
anyone. now generally understood variation might depend
variations oxytocin receptors called gene polymorphisms oxytocin.
Genes can number different sequences them, nucleotide sequences,
won't go genetics right now, Gs Cs Ts various combinations
make genes. Genes transcribed RNA, RNA translated
proteins affect cells, okay? oxytocin gene encodes oxytocin variants
gene change amount function oxytocin. really interesting study
published just last year relatively new journal, journal kind

nowadays, hear lot online, connected not really...
it? communicating not connected connections aren't real.
think going need revisit that. certainly believer idea

thousand us look exact Instagram post, yes, will thousand

heartbeats. socially bonded people social media,
apparent oxytocin system playing role that. this,
zoom makes perfect sense, again, dopamine, serotonin, prolactin, oxytocin,
none systems placed us organized within us order
encourage specific specific types social interactions. one can
say absolutely critical child-parent interaction, right? children simply
can't take care themselves, need caretaker. said caretaker, not
parent. infants, not taken care will die. beyond that, evolved
come realize many different types social interactions, online interactions
nowadays very, common. certainly involved them, guessing
involved well, involved one right now, example. oxytocin
system absolutely threaded largely responsible types social

interested establishing deepening social bonds kind,
important put effort towards thing call emotional empathy,
really sharing autonomic experience. Now, depending relationship

something, really paying attention that, paying attention
think feel something. cognitive empathy is. emotional
cognitive empathy together make really robust bonds various
kinds. Now also talked introversion extroversion, like try
dismantle common misperceptions introversion extroversion
look neural circuitry, recall, introverts not people don't like
social interaction, just feel filled sated less social interaction
extrovert. least according social homeostasis

less dopamine release equivalent amount social interaction. course
aren't precise measurements, whole extroverts need social
interaction, frequent, long-lasting, et cetera, order achieve
dopamine threshold, again, dopamine driving craving social

Allan Schore, spelled S-C-H-O-R-E, love get guest podcast.

or, know, Allan Schore, love get podcast. One key themes
understand biological processes often work short timescales
longer timescales. now, mainly talking stuff
happens short timescales. kind synchronization heart rate activation
given set neurons dumps dopamine causes us seek
social interaction less instance. every biological circuit function needs
longstanding effects well. typically thinking longstanding
effects brain body, start looking towards hormone system. not
always case, often not neuro-transmitters neuromodulators
pretty quick, whereas hormones longer lasting effects. fact, lot hormones
can actually travel nucleus cell actually change genes


expressed. ever hormone hormone-like molecule associated
social bonding, oxytocin, oxytocin gotten ton interest popular
press. don't know is, perhaps incredible things
oxytocin associated with. indeed lot things. instance, oxytocin
released brain binds receptors different locations body,
moment hear different locations body receptors, think, well,
going lots different effects. indeed does. Oxytocin involved orgasm,
involved social recognition. right, see people consider
people, team, group, friends, oxytocin released. Even don't
come physical contact them. Oxytocin also associated pair bonding,
feeling person, person, common language
people use. also associated honesty. Believe not, experiments
show people receive oxytocin inhalation spray, will
honest forthcoming certain things. oxytocin system variants
oxytocin system also associated autism various autism
spectrum disorders. huge range behaviors involved
receptors oxytocin lots different brain structures areas body
different things. However, consistent effects oxytocin
worth just listing off, going talk two separate pathways
oxytocin can manifest effects, can actually regulate oxytocin ways
interesting perhaps useful well. First all, oxytocin involved
milk, let reflex, lactation. makes perfect sense, needs cue
suckling nipple infant causes release let milk,
milk let lactation controlled prolactin, another hormone, also oxytocin.
Oxytocin also involved uterine contraction childbirth, involved cervical
dilation allow baby pass birth canal. involved induction
breastfeeding labor, remarkable especially remarkable given
males least male animals male humans, want say
some, get back this, can involved erection response, can
involved orgasm response males females. Although
interesting difference. little bit controversy this, appear
females, sexual orgasm cause release oxytocin, whereas males,
sexual stimulation not cause release oxytocin, rather different molecule
vasopressin triggered sexual stimulation, orgasm trigger release


oxytocin males, delay 30 minutes. specific
function not clear, seem oxytocin involved sexual
response males females. main types interactions release
oxytocin high levels first all, interaction individuals see
closely associated, right? infant mother closely
associated whether not adopted infant not. Oftentimes close
contact, oftentimes body other. amount
amplitude oxytocin released tends scale closely associated individuals
just sight one's baby smell one's baby can evoke oxytocin release vice
versa mother. Physical contact, even romantic partners. Physical
contact, even sight picture partner can evoke oxytocin release sexual
desire also trust. whole collection psychological physiological
things packaged oxytocin system. not just one way system. Now,
lot people written asking inhaling oxytocin, asking whether
not can actually increase depth rate pair bonding. seem
evidence that. Now, think places, oxytocin prescription,
although might over-the-counter others, don't know, check
far know can't just go buy oxytocin nasal spray, although
may able to, forgive me, naive point. interesting note

say absolutely critical child-parent interaction, right? children simply
can't take care themselves, need caretaker. said caretaker, not
parent. infants, not taken care will die. beyond that, evolved

nowadays very, common. certainly involved them, guessing

01:24:08 Key Points Bonding & Understanding Social Bonds

fifth song Billie Eilish's second album, "Happier Ever." covered
lot biology indeed neural circuitry neurochemistry
neuroendocrinology social bonding. want make sure highlight key
features go social bonds. First all, social bonds
potential include call emotional empathy cognitive empathy.
interested establishing deepening social bonds kind,
important put effort towards thing call emotional empathy,
really sharing autonomic experience. Now, depending relationship
will take different contexts, appropriate one type bond not going
appropriate another type bond. Physical contact instance, appropriate
certain types bonds not others. Nonetheless, emotional empathy
synchronization autonomic function, heart rate breathing, et cetera, can best
accomplished paying attention external events particular narrative story music
perhaps sports types experience external stimulus drive
synchrony internal states. aspect forming deep bonds cognitive
empathy. Again, cognitive empathy not agreeing things viewing things
exact way, really gaining understanding somebody else thinks


something, really paying attention that, paying attention
think feel something. cognitive empathy is. emotional
cognitive empathy together make really robust bonds various
kinds. Now also talked introversion extroversion, like try
dismantle common misperceptions introversion extroversion
look neural circuitry, recall, introverts not people don't like
social interaction, just feel filled sated less social interaction
extrovert. least according social homeostasis
circuit model, actually get dopamine less social interaction. Okay, like
somebody sated less amount food. Okay, doesn't mean don't
appetite, just means get less. Whereas extroverts get
less dopamine release equivalent amount social interaction. course
aren't precise measurements, whole extroverts need social
interaction, frequent, long-lasting, et cetera, order achieve
dopamine threshold, again, dopamine driving craving social
interaction. met, people don't feel like seek social
interaction much. feel introvert extrovert
know introverts extroverts, not verbal people are, not
much seek social interactions per se,

01:27:07 Breaking

much social interaction enough given person. Now, whole
reason providing framework, biological circuitry, et cetera, not simply put
reductionist view things already realized knew, rather give
leverage points understand form social bonds?
might challenged forming certain types social bonds? think
entry points, establishing reinforcing social bonds different kinds.
Hopefully will also give insight breakups, whether
friendships romantic partners can painful. breakup kind involves
breaking emotional empathy cognitive empathy. indeed
neuro-biological hormonal underpinning, right? go sense, social
isolation, even surrounded types people, one major sources
oxytocin one major sources dopamine suddenly not around,


incredibly devastating nervous system. borrow great psychologist
neurobiologist Lisa Feldman Barrett, says, know, not just
individuals, nervous systems influencing nervous systems
nervous systems influencing us. think right way think it.
come no surprise breakups various kinds challenging
regardless underlied breakup, whether not somebody's moving

01:28:36 Synthesis

actual decision one person leave relationship both, et cetera.
positive side, largely biological, extent, psychological view social
bonding will also allow orient vast landscape call social bonds.
understand perhaps seek many online interactions. Maybe
oxytocin polymorphism causes want more, follow accounts,
interact people comment more, respond comments, knows?
also hoping will allow get lens can strengthen social
bonds want strengthen, establish new social bonds want
establish. None meant manipulate leverage social bonds wouldn't
otherwise form, contrary, identifying specific routes
social bonds created allowing you, hope, work people
feel challenged forming social bonds with, maybe deciding completely divorce
social bonds entirely absolutely no hope ever forming
emotional cognitive empathy. certainly acknowledge case too.
light dark gray zone entire thing call social

important us species, whether not distance social media,
whether not close proximity, actual physical contact. Today,
really tried illustrate common set biological, neurochemical
hormonal underpinnings call social bonding. complex

offered leavers entry points can
understand move towards social bonds satisfying
gratifying you. certainly one goals. one hopefully


clinician simply friend people go to, family member people go
