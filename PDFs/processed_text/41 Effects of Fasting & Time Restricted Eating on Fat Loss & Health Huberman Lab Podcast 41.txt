hope enjoy it. Okay, talk feeding, fasting, health performance.
want just establish foundational terms page.


First all, rather talk fasting time restricted feeding, largely going
talk time restricted feeding, please understand time restricted feeding
just one side coin two-sided coin includes fasting one hand,
not eating, time restricted feeding hand, may occasionally say fasting,
fasting eating establish different biological conditions body, time-
restricted feeding term will use describe overall plan restricting one's
eating window called particular phase 24 hour day, cases
two particular days within week. soon learn, aspects
time restricted feeding, aka fasting, involve eating every day, eating one
way five days fasting two days, forth. precise
mean mean it. time being, going refer time
restricted feeding way put umbrella conversation. Second all,
going emphasize lot biological mechanism. listened podcast
before, know always begin biological mechanism. describe tools
implement mechanisms, wholeheartedly believe knowing
mechanisms understanding processes work gives tremendous
flexibility understanding, control processes mental physical

will make clear understand mechanism, true place
power control biology. ever topic controversial,
especially internet, diet nutrition. wading
smile eager anticipation that, wait,
showed that. deal, need precisely define
talking talk nutrition. going give example study
published years ago, 2018, colleague mine Stanford, Chris


Gardner, terrific professor nutrition done lot important studies
nutrition impacts different aspects health. large-scale study.
published JAMA, Journal American Medical Association, one top
tier journals area medicine, certainly paper nutrition show
meant meet exceedingly high standard. paper, Chris
first author, Gardner et al, 2018 JAMA, looked weight loss people following
one particular diet versus another particular diet. 12 month weight loss
study. focused specifically weight loss, although looked
parameters well. basic conclusion study no
significant difference weight change people following healthy, low fat diet
versus healthy, low carbohydrate diet significantly dietary fats them.
caused lot ripples world nutrition nutritional science, certainly
general population, anyone understands diet nutrition
immediately say, wait, sorts different implications eating one type
diet, say low carbohydrate, higher fats, versus higher carbohydrate, lower fat diet.
indeed are. study focused specifically fat loss weight loss.
discuss time restricted feeding, need precise
effects time restricted feeding, eating particular ways particular times,
going emphasize again, whether not study done mice humans,
athletes, men, women, both, study Gardner colleagues
beautiful study, really emphasizes one's main goal simply lose weight,
really not matter one eats provided number calories burned
higher number calories ingested. However, anyone
understands little bit biology, lot biology will agree many factors
impact calories burned part equation. obvious.
instance, amount exercise, type exercise, basal metabolic rate, much energy
one burns just sitting there. talked podcast NEIT, Non Exercise
Induced Thermogenesis, people bounce around lot fidget lot, can
burn anywhere 800 2,000 calories per day. quote-unquote basal
metabolic rate actually much higher simply fidgeters, whereas people
tend stationary lower basal metabolic rate, average.
great science support this. Metabolic factors hormones also important.
Hormones, thyroid hormone insulin growth hormone, sex story
hormones, testosterone estrogen, levels will also profoundly influence


calories out, calories burned component calories in, calories equation.
internet listening particular podcast speaker, somebody
says, ideal diet, calories in, calories not matter, calories
calories thing matters. think important understand
foundational truths, calories in, calories out, course,
hormone factors context given diet regimen taking place
exceedingly important. good example puberty time life, sex
steroid hormones changing profoundly body growth hormone
hormones. much caloric intake directed towards protein synthesis, towards
production muscle bone tissues body.
changes hormones call puberty. So, no way can drill every
aspect given feeding plan feeding schedule allow us tap every
aspect list read weight loss, fat loss, muscle organ, genome,
epigenome, inflammation, exercise, cognition, mood, lifespan. today,
going precise time restricted feeding, clear
animal studies human studies can powerful positive impact
everything weight loss fat loss various health parameters. beautiful

00:19:48 Feeding-Induced Health Conditions

eat things going best serve goals. talk eating
happens eat, talk fasting, not eating,
happens fast. entire episode eating metabolism,
hormones factors impact appetite. don't time go
details now, although welcome listen episode well, can briefly
describe overall conditions set body eat don't
eat. key word conditions. can emphasize anything today,
eat eat set conditions body, conditions can


good you, bad you, depending eat. fact, eat
important eat. repeat that, eat important
eat, least relates health parameters, particular, liver health mental
health. simple rules eating. First all, eat, typically blood
glucose, blood sugar, will go up. Also, insulin levels will go up. Insulin hormone
involved mobilizing glucose bloodstream. much glucose
insulin go depends eat much eat. general, simple
sugars, including fructose fruit, also sucrose glucose, simple sugars
will raise insulin blood glucose complex carbohydrates. Things like
grains, breads, pastas, forth, grains, breads, pastas,
forth will raise blood glucose fibrous carbohydrates, like lettuce,
broccoli, things sort. Protein somewhat moderate modest impact
insulin glucose, fat lowest impact raising blood glucose
blood insulin. eat will impact steep rise blood glucose insulin
takes place. number factors related individual health
will also dictate steep high rise glucose insulin will be.
time being, leaving people type one diabetes. people
don't manufacture insulin, type two diabetes essentially insulin
insensitivity, lack sensitivity insulin, leads high blood glucose. But,
eat, blood glucose goes don't eat, blood glucose insulin go
down. longer since last meal, lower, typically, blood glucose
insulin will be. higher, things like GLP1, glucagon-like peptide 1, glucagon
hormone also secreted fasted state low blood
glucose state. involved mobilizing various energy sources body, including
fat call lipolysis, also using carbohydrates, potentially even using
muscle source energy. So, kind fire hose information
happens eat don't eat, just think way, blood sugar insulin
go eat, go don't eat, hormones go
don't eat. hormones associated fasted state,
hormones associated eating just eaten state. Now,
important thing understand that, like everything biology, process
takes time. insulin glucose go eat, takes period time
go down, even stop eating, will remain period time,
go back down, takes time. important, look


scientific literature fasting, time-restricted feeding, absolutely clear
health benefits, not just weight loss benefits, health benefits time-
restricted feeding, occur certain conditions met brain body

mentioned earlier one study, says goal weight loss, really
not matter foods consume, provided consume sub-

imagine different pattern eating feeding window starts afternoon
starts around two even 3:00 PM. people don't much trouble can
train get feeding window two 3:00 PM, won't

can comfortably manage, okay? Meaning average, can obey six hour


feeding window eight hour feeding window 10 hour feeding window.
place feeding window social life context can manage

want just establish foundational terms page.


First all, rather talk fasting time restricted feeding, largely going
talk time restricted feeding, please understand time restricted feeding
just one side coin two-sided coin includes fasting one hand,
not eating, time restricted feeding hand, may occasionally say fasting,
fasting eating establish different biological conditions body, time-
restricted feeding term will use describe overall plan restricting one's
eating window called particular phase 24 hour day, cases
two particular days within week. soon learn, aspects
time restricted feeding, aka fasting, involve eating every day, eating one
way five days fasting two days, forth. precise
mean mean it. time being, going refer time
restricted feeding way put umbrella conversation. Second all,
going emphasize lot biological mechanism. listened podcast
before, know always begin biological mechanism. describe tools
implement mechanisms, wholeheartedly believe knowing
mechanisms understanding processes work gives tremendous
flexibility understanding, control processes mental physical

work, will not give kind understanding allow

will make clear understand mechanism, true place
power control biology. ever topic controversial,
especially internet, diet nutrition. wading
smile eager anticipation that, wait,
showed that. deal, need precisely define
talking talk nutrition. going give example study
published years ago, 2018, colleague mine Stanford, Chris


Gardner, terrific professor nutrition done lot important studies
nutrition impacts different aspects health. large-scale study.
published JAMA, Journal American Medical Association, one top
tier journals area medicine, certainly paper nutrition show
meant meet exceedingly high standard. paper, Chris
first author, Gardner et al, 2018 JAMA, looked weight loss people following
one particular diet versus another particular diet. 12 month weight loss
study. focused specifically weight loss, although looked
parameters well. basic conclusion study no
significant difference weight change people following healthy, low fat diet
versus healthy, low carbohydrate diet significantly dietary fats them.
caused lot ripples world nutrition nutritional science, certainly
general population, anyone understands diet nutrition
immediately say, wait, sorts different implications eating one type
diet, say low carbohydrate, higher fats, versus higher carbohydrate, lower fat diet.
indeed are. study focused specifically fat loss weight loss.
discuss time restricted feeding, need precise
effects time restricted feeding, eating particular ways particular times,
going emphasize again, whether not study done mice humans,
athletes, men, women, both, study Gardner colleagues
beautiful study, really emphasizes one's main goal simply lose weight,
really not matter one eats provided number calories burned
higher number calories ingested. However, anyone
understands little bit biology, lot biology will agree many factors
impact calories burned part equation. obvious.
instance, amount exercise, type exercise, basal metabolic rate, much energy
one burns just sitting there. talked podcast NEIT, Non Exercise
Induced Thermogenesis, people bounce around lot fidget lot, can
burn anywhere 800 2,000 calories per day. quote-unquote basal
metabolic rate actually much higher simply fidgeters, whereas people
tend stationary lower basal metabolic rate, average.
great science support this. Metabolic factors hormones also important.
Hormones, thyroid hormone insulin growth hormone, sex story
hormones, testosterone estrogen, levels will also profoundly influence


calories out, calories burned component calories in, calories equation.
internet listening particular podcast speaker, somebody
says, ideal diet, calories in, calories not matter, calories
calories thing matters. think important understand
foundational truths, calories in, calories out, course,
hormone factors context given diet regimen taking place
exceedingly important. good example puberty time life, sex
steroid hormones changing profoundly body growth hormone
hormones. much caloric intake directed towards protein synthesis, towards
production muscle bone tissues body.
changes hormones call puberty. So, no way can drill every
aspect given feeding plan feeding schedule allow us tap every
aspect list read weight loss, fat loss, muscle organ, genome,
epigenome, inflammation, exercise, cognition, mood, lifespan. today,
going precise time restricted feeding, clear
animal studies human studies can powerful positive impact
everything weight loss fat loss various health parameters. beautiful
literature emerged mostly last 10 15 years. march

perfect diet given day contextual, meaning depends

00:19:48 Feeding-Induced Health Conditions

eat things going best serve goals. talk eating

happens fast. entire episode eating metabolism,
hormones factors impact appetite. don't time go
details now, although welcome listen episode well, can briefly
describe overall conditions set body eat don't
eat. key word conditions. can emphasize anything today,
eat eat set conditions body, conditions can


good you, bad you, depending eat. fact, eat
important eat. repeat that, eat important
eat, least relates health parameters, particular, liver health mental
health. simple rules eating. First all, eat, typically blood
glucose, blood sugar, will go up. Also, insulin levels will go up. Insulin hormone
involved mobilizing glucose bloodstream. much glucose
insulin go depends eat much eat. general, simple
sugars, including fructose fruit, also sucrose glucose, simple sugars
will raise insulin blood glucose complex carbohydrates. Things like
grains, breads, pastas, forth, grains, breads, pastas,
forth will raise blood glucose fibrous carbohydrates, like lettuce,
broccoli, things sort. Protein somewhat moderate modest impact
insulin glucose, fat lowest impact raising blood glucose
blood insulin. eat will impact steep rise blood glucose insulin
takes place. number factors related individual health
will also dictate steep high rise glucose insulin will be.
time being, leaving people type one diabetes. people
don't manufacture insulin, type two diabetes essentially insulin
insensitivity, lack sensitivity insulin, leads high blood glucose. But,
eat, blood glucose goes don't eat, blood glucose insulin go
down. longer since last meal, lower, typically, blood glucose
insulin will be. higher, things like GLP1, glucagon-like peptide 1, glucagon
hormone also secreted fasted state low blood
glucose state. involved mobilizing various energy sources body, including
fat call lipolysis, also using carbohydrates, potentially even using
muscle source energy. So, kind fire hose information
happens eat don't eat, just think way, blood sugar insulin
go eat, go don't eat, hormones go
don't eat. hormones associated fasted state,
hormones associated eating just eaten state. Now,
important thing understand that, like everything biology, process
takes time. insulin glucose go eat, takes period time
go down, even stop eating, will remain period time,
go back down, takes time. important, look


scientific literature fasting, time-restricted feeding, absolutely clear
health benefits, not just weight loss benefits, health benefits time-
restricted feeding, occur certain conditions met brain body
certain amount time. gives us anchor view eating
terms sets conditions body time. sounds overly analytic,
promise you, simplest best way think eating schedule
eating plan. think fair say field nutrition, landmark
studies serve really strong anchors building understanding eat
not eat eat, depending goals. Gardner study
mentioned earlier one study, says goal weight loss, really
not matter foods consume, provided consume sub-
maintenance, caloric diet. However, want emphasize again, sets aside issues
adherence, meaning easy hard adhere given diet. people find
much easier follow high fat, low carbohydrate diet. people fall follow
different diet much easier follow. people
concerned mental performance athletic performance. study doesn't say
best diet, says consume less important
amount food consume,

00:25:33 Time Restricted Eating: Eat Vital

least sake weight loss, not necessarily sake health. Now, study
going refer next consider second major pillar nutritional
studies. truly landmark study carried Satchin Panda,
professor Salk Institute Biological Studies San Diego, absolutely
phenomenal institution, absolutely phenomenal researcher. known Satchin
number years, want emphasize current literature intermittent

years different cultures religions, science time-restricted feeding can
really mainly attributed incredible work Satchin done. grateful
consider friend colleague, consulted length anticipation
episode. also hope guest future. landmark paper


came Satchin's lab published 2012. paper mice set
basis studies humans came later. title paper time-
restricted feeding without reducing caloric intake, prevents metabolic diseases mice
fed high fat diet. title tells us lot. says varied study not
mice ate, ate it. essentially four conditions
study results absolutely remarkable. going walk
major results. gave mice access different types food.
four groups, one group mice access just normal mouse diet.
not diet interested in. confess actually tasted mouse
chow. work mice all, just it. least doesn't taste
good, tastes like bland Graham cracker cookie. confessed that.
tiniest little bit, mice like stuff. allow eat stuff,
called ad libitum whenever want, just keep food. 24 hours
day, will eat sometimes, won't eat times, case,
also condition gave mouse chow time restricted way,
just certain number hours day, eight hours, gave
high-fat diet. separate group, got high-fat diet time wanted.
kind carnival mice mice really like high fat, highly palatable
foods. got lot goodies high-fat food.
fourth group access high fat diet much wanted eat,
restricted time period 24 hour cycle, now mice nocturnal. Humans
call diurnal, actually, not really diurnal crepuscular,
means active morning evening, not much
afternoon, nonetheless, everything going tell true also humans.
know now human studies, one important things take away
study mice ate highly palatable high-fat diet, great tasting diet,
restricted feeding window 24 hour cycle maintained lost
weight time, whereas mice ingested diet, amount calories,
access calories around clock, gained weight, became obese
quite sick. additional second point, mice restricted feeding
window particular portion eight hours every 24 hour cycle actually showed
improvement important health markers. even incredible
mice ate particular feeding window, also experienced
reversal prior negative health effects. study really lit world got


people excited

hope enjoy it. Okay, talk feeding, fasting, health performance.
want just establish foundational terms page.


First all, rather talk fasting time restricted feeding, largely going
talk time restricted feeding, please understand time restricted feeding
just one side coin two-sided coin includes fasting one hand,
not eating, time restricted feeding hand, may occasionally say fasting,
fasting eating establish different biological conditions body, time-
restricted feeding term will use describe overall plan restricting one's
eating window called particular phase 24 hour day, cases
two particular days within week. soon learn, aspects
time restricted feeding, aka fasting, involve eating every day, eating one
way five days fasting two days, forth. precise
mean mean it. time being, going refer time
restricted feeding way put umbrella conversation. Second all,
going emphasize lot biological mechanism. listened podcast
before, know always begin biological mechanism. describe tools
implement mechanisms, wholeheartedly believe knowing
mechanisms understanding processes work gives tremendous
flexibility understanding, control processes mental physical
health. Whereas just list off menu things not do, will
work, will not give kind understanding allow
navigate life, travel, dinners out, different exercise

will make clear understand mechanism, true place
power control biology. ever topic controversial,
especially internet, diet nutrition. wading
smile eager anticipation that, wait,
showed that. deal, need precisely define
talking talk nutrition. going give example study
published years ago, 2018, colleague mine Stanford, Chris


Gardner, terrific professor nutrition done lot important studies
nutrition impacts different aspects health. large-scale study.
published JAMA, Journal American Medical Association, one top
tier journals area medicine, certainly paper nutrition show
meant meet exceedingly high standard. paper, Chris
first author, Gardner et al, 2018 JAMA, looked weight loss people following
one particular diet versus another particular diet. 12 month weight loss
study. focused specifically weight loss, although looked
parameters well. basic conclusion study no
significant difference weight change people following healthy, low fat diet
versus healthy, low carbohydrate diet significantly dietary fats them.
caused lot ripples world nutrition nutritional science, certainly
general population, anyone understands diet nutrition
immediately say, wait, sorts different implications eating one type
diet, say low carbohydrate, higher fats, versus higher carbohydrate, lower fat diet.
indeed are. study focused specifically fat loss weight loss.
discuss time restricted feeding, need precise
effects time restricted feeding, eating particular ways particular times,
going emphasize again, whether not study done mice humans,
athletes, men, women, both, study Gardner colleagues
beautiful study, really emphasizes one's main goal simply lose weight,
really not matter one eats provided number calories burned
higher number calories ingested. However, anyone
understands little bit biology, lot biology will agree many factors
impact calories burned part equation. obvious.
instance, amount exercise, type exercise, basal metabolic rate, much energy
one burns just sitting there. talked podcast NEIT, Non Exercise
Induced Thermogenesis, people bounce around lot fidget lot, can
burn anywhere 800 2,000 calories per day. quote-unquote basal
metabolic rate actually much higher simply fidgeters, whereas people
tend stationary lower basal metabolic rate, average.
great science support this. Metabolic factors hormones also important.
Hormones, thyroid hormone insulin growth hormone, sex story
hormones, testosterone estrogen, levels will also profoundly influence


calories out, calories burned component calories in, calories equation.
internet listening particular podcast speaker, somebody
says, ideal diet, calories in, calories not matter, calories
calories thing matters. think important understand
foundational truths, calories in, calories out, course,
hormone factors context given diet regimen taking place
exceedingly important. good example puberty time life, sex
steroid hormones changing profoundly body growth hormone
hormones. much caloric intake directed towards protein synthesis, towards
production muscle bone tissues body.
changes hormones call puberty. So, no way can drill every
aspect given feeding plan feeding schedule allow us tap every
aspect list read weight loss, fat loss, muscle organ, genome,
epigenome, inflammation, exercise, cognition, mood, lifespan. today,
going precise time restricted feeding, clear
animal studies human studies can powerful positive impact
everything weight loss fat loss various health parameters. beautiful
literature emerged mostly last 10 15 years. march

00:19:48 Feeding-Induced Health Conditions

eat things going best serve goals. talk eating
happens eat, talk fasting, not eating,
happens fast. entire episode eating metabolism,
hormones factors impact appetite. don't time go
details now, although welcome listen episode well, can briefly
describe overall conditions set body eat don't
eat. key word conditions. can emphasize anything today,
eat eat set conditions body, conditions can


good you, bad you, depending eat. fact, eat
important eat. repeat that, eat important
eat, least relates health parameters, particular, liver health mental
health. simple rules eating. First all, eat, typically blood
glucose, blood sugar, will go up. Also, insulin levels will go up. Insulin hormone
involved mobilizing glucose bloodstream. much glucose
insulin go depends eat much eat. general, simple
sugars, including fructose fruit, also sucrose glucose, simple sugars
will raise insulin blood glucose complex carbohydrates. Things like
grains, breads, pastas, forth, grains, breads, pastas,
forth will raise blood glucose fibrous carbohydrates, like lettuce,
broccoli, things sort. Protein somewhat moderate modest impact
insulin glucose, fat lowest impact raising blood glucose
blood insulin. eat will impact steep rise blood glucose insulin
takes place. number factors related individual health
will also dictate steep high rise glucose insulin will be.
time being, leaving people type one diabetes. people
don't manufacture insulin, type two diabetes essentially insulin
insensitivity, lack sensitivity insulin, leads high blood glucose. But,
eat, blood glucose goes don't eat, blood glucose insulin go
down. longer since last meal, lower, typically, blood glucose
insulin will be. higher, things like GLP1, glucagon-like peptide 1, glucagon
hormone also secreted fasted state low blood
glucose state. involved mobilizing various energy sources body, including
fat call lipolysis, also using carbohydrates, potentially even using
muscle source energy. So, kind fire hose information
happens eat don't eat, just think way, blood sugar insulin
go eat, go don't eat, hormones go
don't eat. hormones associated fasted state,
hormones associated eating just eaten state. Now,
important thing understand that, like everything biology, process
takes time. insulin glucose go eat, takes period time
go down, even stop eating, will remain period time,
go back down, takes time. important, look


scientific literature fasting, time-restricted feeding, absolutely clear
health benefits, not just weight loss benefits, health benefits time-

came Satchin's lab published 2012. paper mice set
basis studies humans came later. title paper time-
restricted feeding without reducing caloric intake, prevents metabolic diseases mice
fed high fat diet. title tells us lot. says varied study not
mice ate, ate it. essentially four conditions
study results absolutely remarkable. going walk
major results. gave mice access different types food.
four groups, one group mice access just normal mouse diet.
not diet interested in. confess actually tasted mouse
chow. work mice all, just it. least doesn't taste
good, tastes like bland Graham cracker cookie. confessed that.
tiniest little bit, mice like stuff. allow eat stuff,
called ad libitum whenever want, just keep food. 24 hours

also condition gave mouse chow time restricted way,
just certain number hours day, eight hours, gave

kind carnival mice mice really like high fat, highly palatable
foods. got lot goodies high-fat food.
fourth group access high fat diet much wanted eat,
restricted time period 24 hour cycle, now mice nocturnal. Humans
call diurnal, actually, not really diurnal crepuscular,
means active morning evening, not much

know now human studies, one important things take away
study mice ate highly palatable high-fat diet, great tasting diet,
restricted feeding window 24 hour cycle maintained lost
weight time, whereas mice ingested diet, amount calories,
access calories around clock, gained weight, became obese
quite sick. additional second point, mice restricted feeding

improvement important health markers. even incredible
mice ate particular feeding window, also experienced
reversal prior negative health effects. study really lit world got


people excited

00:29:45 Eight Hour Feeding Window

time-restricted eating again. use eight hour feeding window. story
around eight hour feeding window kind interesting though. Not many people

00:36:33 Liver Health

short takeaway probably want think perhaps even

side coin, best fast? So, fasting
sleep, clear best extend sleep-related fast either
morning start evening. Now might seem kind obvious, actually
not obvious. place feeding window early day, middle day

window tacked attached sleep based fasting way makes
easier get fasted state period time. can view point
perspective best, better worst, okay? like people
sleep night, waking somewhere around 6:30, 7:00 AM, maybe even
8:00 AM. say push fasting window out, started
eating noon, stopped eating 6:00 PM. Well, not eating
6:00 PM say bedtime 10:00 PM, 6:00 PM 10:00 PM,
body not yet fasted state just ate. However, starting
taper fastest state sleep sleep. next
morning late morning, actually fasted state, now, people find
hard eat middle day, best, ideal sake
fasting related improvements health, not ideal. not applicable
work family social situations. people eat breakfast others and,
eat dinner others. people eat lunch others, general, hard
restrict feeding window just absolute middle day, purely
health perspective, objective way, ideal situation.
imagine different pattern eating feeding window starts afternoon
starts around two even 3:00 PM. people don't much trouble can
train get feeding window two 3:00 PM, won't
eat 10 11:00 PM. Right, math, realize feeding window
still pretty short. still constitutes call intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding. assuming go bed around 11:00 PM midnight,
not actually fasted sleep first six hours sleep, maybe five,
probably like six hours sleep, still digesting food
consumed late night. appear beneficial grab hold sleep-
related fast, meaning don't want feeding window close bedtime.
came kind foundational pillar discussed
earlier, least no eating first hour waking, also no eating

goes six maybe 8:00 PM. seems me, least based data

00:52:35 Effects Specific Categories Food

fasting related sleep. Now, number caveats details related this,
important caveat detail related people specifically interested

clearly talk feeding window, feeding window
include number different foods, involve cake ice cream, pizza,
hamburgers, plants, fruit, whatever is, involve just fats just proteins, et

lot fats will tend slow gastric emptying time. depending kind fats,
mean given meal digested within three hours versus five hours.
fats might large meal lot fats been, can take five six hours.
smaller meal less fat going digested quickly consuming calories

course, glucose insulin aspect it, foods lead

release glucose. important thing establish feeding window
can comfortably manage, okay? Meaning average, can obey six hour


feeding window eight hour feeding window 10 hour feeding window.
place feeding window social life context can manage
regular basis, now, two key points gleaned

Meaning people think eight hour feeding window six hour
feeding window, data analyzed, almost always case
actually feeding window one even two hours longer think
think, well, possibly people taking first bite noon
taking last bite 8:00 PM? Well, must mean

reviewing literature, clear like 10 hour feeding window,
probably select eight hour feeding window, always little

eating windows. just hard context life events social
gatherings and, family forth. Okay, build forward, ideal fasting
slash time-restricted feeding schedule, now several different rules can
list first, least no food first hour waking least one hour, two, no


food intake two ideally three hours prior bedtime. Three, want
select eight hour feeding window, probably focus six seven
hour feeding window reality, feeding window going longer

going emphasize again, whether not study done mice humans,
athletes, men, women, both, study Gardner colleagues
beautiful study, really emphasizes one's main goal simply lose weight,
really not matter one eats provided number calories burned
higher number calories ingested. However, anyone
understands little bit biology, lot biology will agree many factors
impact calories burned part equation. obvious.
instance, amount exercise, type exercise, basal metabolic rate, much energy
one burns just sitting there. talked podcast NEIT, Non Exercise
Induced Thermogenesis, people bounce around lot fidget lot, can
burn anywhere 800 2,000 calories per day. quote-unquote basal

great science support this. Metabolic factors hormones also important.
Hormones, thyroid hormone insulin growth hormone, sex story

glucose, blood sugar, will go up. Also, insulin levels will go up. Insulin hormone
involved mobilizing glucose bloodstream. much glucose
insulin go depends eat much eat. general, simple
sugars, including fructose fruit, also sucrose glucose, simple sugars
will raise insulin blood glucose complex carbohydrates. Things like
grains, breads, pastas, forth, grains, breads, pastas,
forth will raise blood glucose fibrous carbohydrates, like lettuce,

will also dictate steep high rise glucose insulin will be.
time being, leaving people type one diabetes. people
don't manufacture insulin, type two diabetes essentially insulin
insensitivity, lack sensitivity insulin, leads high blood glucose. But,
eat, blood glucose goes don't eat, blood glucose insulin go
down. longer since last meal, lower, typically, blood glucose
insulin will be. higher, things like GLP1, glucagon-like peptide 1, glucagon
hormone also secreted fasted state low blood

nutrition impacts different aspects health. large-scale study.
published JAMA, Journal American Medical Association, one top
tier journals area medicine, certainly paper nutrition show
meant meet exceedingly high standard. paper, Chris
first author, Gardner et al, 2018 JAMA, looked weight loss people following
one particular diet versus another particular diet. 12 month weight loss
study. focused specifically weight loss, although looked
parameters well. basic conclusion study no
significant difference weight change people following healthy, low fat diet
versus healthy, low carbohydrate diet significantly dietary fats them.
caused lot ripples world nutrition nutritional science, certainly
general population, anyone understands diet nutrition
immediately say, wait, sorts different implications eating one type
diet, say low carbohydrate, higher fats, versus higher carbohydrate, lower fat diet.
indeed are. study focused specifically fat loss weight loss.
discuss time restricted feeding, need precise
effects time restricted feeding, eating particular ways particular times,
going emphasize again, whether not study done mice humans,
athletes, men, women, both, study Gardner colleagues
beautiful study, really emphasizes one's main goal simply lose weight,
really not matter one eats provided number calories burned
higher number calories ingested. However, anyone
understands little bit biology, lot biology will agree many factors
impact calories burned part equation. obvious.
instance, amount exercise, type exercise, basal metabolic rate, much energy
one burns just sitting there. talked podcast NEIT, Non Exercise
Induced Thermogenesis, people bounce around lot fidget lot, can
burn anywhere 800 2,000 calories per day. quote-unquote basal
metabolic rate actually much higher simply fidgeters, whereas people
tend stationary lower basal metabolic rate, average.
great science support this. Metabolic factors hormones also important.
Hormones, thyroid hormone insulin growth hormone, sex story
hormones, testosterone estrogen, levels will also profoundly influence


calories out, calories burned component calories in, calories equation.
internet listening particular podcast speaker, somebody
says, ideal diet, calories in, calories not matter, calories
calories thing matters. think important understand
foundational truths, calories in, calories out, course,
hormone factors context given diet regimen taking place

production muscle bone tissues body.
changes hormones call puberty. So, no way can drill every
aspect given feeding plan feeding schedule allow us tap every
aspect list read weight loss, fat loss, muscle organ, genome,
epigenome, inflammation, exercise, cognition, mood, lifespan. today,
going precise time restricted feeding, clear
animal studies human studies can powerful positive impact
everything weight loss fat loss various health parameters. beautiful

important thing understand that, like everything biology, process

ingesting protein early day sake muscle maintenance hypertrophy.
somebody mainly concerned muscle maintenance hypertrophy,


may make sense move feeding window earlier day. certainly
people interested muscle maintenance hypertrophy,
aren't intermittent fasting all, also perfectly fine, just
happens episode intermittent fasting time restricted feeding.
course, modes eating one eats small meals spread throughout day
weights meals differently. meals early day larger later
day vice versa. near infinite number ways organize this.
somebody interested deriving, many clearly established health effects
time-restricted feeding, somebody like maintain build

least basis results. therefore eight hour window
established less ideal shifted later part day might not
beneficial you. Now can just personally say me. wake

side coin, best fast? So, fasting

morning late morning, actually fasted state, now, people find

fasting related improvements health, not ideal. not applicable
work family social situations. people eat breakfast others and,
eat dinner others. people eat lunch others, general, hard
restrict feeding window just absolute middle day, purely

imagine different pattern eating feeding window starts afternoon
starts around two even 3:00 PM. people don't much trouble can
train get feeding window two 3:00 PM, won't
eat 10 11:00 PM. Right, math, realize feeding window
still pretty short. still constitutes call intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding. assuming go bed around 11:00 PM midnight,
not actually fasted sleep first six hours sleep, maybe five,
probably like six hours sleep, still digesting food
consumed late night. appear beneficial grab hold sleep-

scientific literature says drinking water will not break fast drinking tea will not break
fast drinking coffee, provided black coffee will not break fast ingesting
caffeine pill form will not break fast. things won't break

eating whole handful peanuts might not even break fast low

large meal kind hour ago, yes, indeed, eating one peanut break
fast. contextual, really important understand, unless
going wear continuous glucose monitor. unless going wear

anything involves sugar particular, simple sugars can potentially break fast.

00:36:33 Liver Health

short takeaway probably want think perhaps even
engage time, restricted feeding. So, mentioned earlier, mice can eat around
clock, bad things happen. one bad things happens liver
suffers, liver involved sorts things, production important hormones
factors related metabolism. mice can eat around clock, livers
got sick, fatty deposits liver. factors liver essentially taken
pathway liver disease, time restricted feeding, essentially reversed led
many cases even healthier liver conditions, based study,
also additional studies also now humans. restricting feeding particular
window, every 24 hour cycle clearly shown now mice humans
enhance liver health, wonderful. this, well, happens
food intake, mentioned earlier, sets certain conditions body lasts

came Satchin's lab published 2012. paper mice set
basis studies humans came later. title paper time-
restricted feeding without reducing caloric intake, prevents metabolic diseases mice
fed high fat diet. title tells us lot. says varied study not
mice ate, ate it. essentially four conditions
study results absolutely remarkable. going walk
major results. gave mice access different types food.
four groups, one group mice access just normal mouse diet.
not diet interested in. confess actually tasted mouse
chow. work mice all, just it. least doesn't taste
good, tastes like bland Graham cracker cookie. confessed that.
tiniest little bit, mice like stuff. allow eat stuff,
called ad libitum whenever want, just keep food. 24 hours
day, will eat sometimes, won't eat times, case,
also condition gave mouse chow time restricted way,
just certain number hours day, eight hours, gave
high-fat diet. separate group, got high-fat diet time wanted.
kind carnival mice mice really like high fat, highly palatable
foods. got lot goodies high-fat food.
fourth group access high fat diet much wanted eat,
restricted time period 24 hour cycle, now mice nocturnal. Humans
call diurnal, actually, not really diurnal crepuscular,
means active morning evening, not much

restricted feeding window 24 hour cycle maintained lost
weight time, whereas mice ingested diet, amount calories,
access calories around clock, gained weight, became obese

answer question, best eat actually best answered thinking


side coin, best fast? So, fasting

perspective best, better worst, okay? like people
sleep night, waking somewhere around 6:30, 7:00 AM, maybe even
8:00 AM. say push fasting window out, started
eating noon, stopped eating 6:00 PM. Well, not eating
6:00 PM say bedtime 10:00 PM, 6:00 PM 10:00 PM,
body not yet fasted state just ate. However, starting
taper fastest state sleep sleep. next
morning late morning, actually fasted state, now, people find

fasting related improvements health, not ideal. not applicable
work family social situations. people eat breakfast others and,
eat dinner others. people eat lunch others, general, hard
restrict feeding window just absolute middle day, purely
health perspective, objective way, ideal situation.
imagine different pattern eating feeding window starts afternoon
starts around two even 3:00 PM. people don't much trouble can
train get feeding window two 3:00 PM, won't
eat 10 11:00 PM. Right, math, realize feeding window
still pretty short. still constitutes call intermittent fasting time
restricted feeding. assuming go bed around 11:00 PM midnight,
not actually fasted sleep first six hours sleep, maybe five,
probably like six hours sleep, still digesting food
consumed late night. appear beneficial grab hold sleep-

release glucose. important thing establish feeding window
can comfortably manage, okay? Meaning average, can obey six hour


feeding window eight hour feeding window 10 hour feeding window.
place feeding window social life context can manage
regular basis, now, two key points gleaned

00:55:40 Precision Fasting: Protocol Build

scientific data feeding window place it. based
really important experiment Satchin colleagues doing.

Meaning people think eight hour feeding window six hour
feeding window, data analyzed, almost always case
actually feeding window one even two hours longer think
think, well, possibly people taking first bite noon
taking last bite 8:00 PM? Well, must mean
feeding window eight hours. turns people cheat, don't cheat
kind obvious way. might have, know, glass wine dinner,
cup tea little bite cookie. people honest
honest, cases experiment, find people's
eating window actually quite bit longer. discussing
reviewing literature, clear like 10 hour feeding window,
probably select eight hour feeding window, always little
bit taper either side eating window. people extremely strict
eating windows. just hard context life events social
gatherings and, family forth. Okay, build forward, ideal fasting
slash time-restricted feeding schedule, now several different rules can
list first, least no food first hour waking least one hour, two, no


food intake two ideally three hours prior bedtime. Three, want
select eight hour feeding window, probably focus six seven
hour feeding window reality, feeding window going longer
reality, meaning real life constraints. like 10 hour feeding window,
probably select eight nine hour feeding window, way
plays people almost always eat outside eating window, somewhat.
nice thing selecting slightly shorter eating window comfortable
takes account take last bite last sip

eating different things different days, presumably foods leave
gut quickly. things spike insulin glucose
others. Sometimes eat fat, sometimes less fat. allows fall well
within margins benefits time-restricted feeding demonstrated
humans, generally involve eight hour window so. think eight hour

will discuss exceptions, people truly exceptions this.

00:59:30 4-6 Hour Feeding Windows

just require food. along lines, just now briefly want touch
studies looked using short feeding window four
hours, nowadays, number people so-called one meal per day,
restricting feeding window just four hours six hours. turns
interesting strategy data around actually little bit surprising. One
surprising thing leap massive literature review time restricted feeding
humans relatively short feeding windows say four six hours produce
number positive health effects. Things like increased insulin sensitivity,
know good, remember type two diabetes reduction insulin sensitivity
improvements beta cell function pancreas decreased blood pressure,
decreased oxidative stress decreases things like evening appetite. positive health
effects psychological facts general. However, either produce no change
body weight, tend produce even increases body weight, now, course
variation individuals studies, somewhat
surprising. eight hour feeding window seems beneficial across almost


parameters discussed, inflammation, weight, loss, fat loss, et cetera,
adherence. mention people's ability stick diet seems quite good
eight hour feeding windows, people try undergo short feeding
windows four six hours, seems overeating four six hours,
least overeating respect metabolic needs. Now, contrast so-
called one meal per day schedule, studies one meal per day, one meal per
day, unless very, long meal, sort feast typically not last four six
hours sort depends define meal. look
few, emphasize, again, studies one meal per day. People
typically maintain lose weight one meal per day schedule. can say
seven nine hour feeding window produces major health benefits
time-restricted feeding well pretty straightforward people adhere
regular basis regular basis, turns important. get back
point moment. Whereas four six hour eating window doesn't seem
serve people well say seven eight hour eating window, simply people
overeating eating window one meal per day, perhaps ideal
certain people's schedules may actually cause people under-eat.
cases might people want. actually want under-eat.
start thinking work sport, start considering hormone health
hormone production, fertility, can really start look seven

01:03:08 Protein Consumption & Timing Muscle

excellent studies this. explore now. talk
conditions feeding window early day actually
beneficial. study published recently Cell Reports, again,
Cell Press Journal, excellent journal peer reviewed, stringent, Aoyama, et al,
AOYAMA, et al. published just recently July, 2021 looked


distribution protein intake different meals delivered either early day
later day. summarizing quite lot, mention
study performed mice humans, paper, mice humans
involved hypertrophy training, essentially increasing weight bearing given limbs
try induce hypertrophy, growth muscle tissue. appear
muscle tissue better able undergo hypertrophy virtue fact
better enhanced protein synthesis early day, expression one
particular clock genes called BMAL, BMAL, BMAL regulates number
different protein synthesis pathways within muscle cells, eating protein early
day, supports muscle tissue maintenance growth. study, also
looked effects supplementing so-called BCAs branch chain amino acids,
popular bodybuilding circles strength training circles BCAs essential
components number different foods, can also supplemented.
takeaway study pretty straight forward. However, takeaway main
interest maintaining and, building muscle, can beneficial ingest protein
early day, still want obey this, calling kind
foundational rule no, not eating food first hour post waking least
first hour post. cutoff want eat protein sometime
10:00 AM. averaging across number different situations,
general, BMAL expression say wake 7:00 AM. main
interest hypertrophy maintenance muscle. want ingest
protein sometime 10:00 AM. obviously interested getting
health effects intermittent fasting, wouldn't ingest food least first
60 minutes upon waking. Now not 10:01 gate slam shut can't
generate hypertrophy, course not case. However, interesting
doesn't matter resistance training, load bearing exercise occurs 24
hour cycle. whether not words, people training early day
training late day. still appears ingesting protein early day
favors hypertrophy one better, say easily able access
hypertrophy way clock, regulated protein synthesis mechanisms ingesting
protein early day, no way, shape form study say ingesting
protein later day somehow bad you? just emphasizes positive effects
ingesting protein early day sake muscle maintenance hypertrophy.
somebody mainly concerned muscle maintenance hypertrophy,


may make sense move feeding window earlier day. certainly
people interested muscle maintenance hypertrophy,
aren't intermittent fasting all, also perfectly fine, just
happens episode intermittent fasting time restricted feeding.
course, modes eating one eats small meals spread throughout day
weights meals differently. meals early day larger later
day vice versa. near infinite number ways organize this.
somebody interested deriving, many clearly established health effects
time-restricted feeding, somebody like maintain build
muscle, ingesting proteins early part day important
least basis results. therefore eight hour window
established less ideal shifted later part day might not
beneficial you. Now can just personally say me. wake
morning, easy not eat noon one 2:00 PM. Eating early
day actually somewhat challenge. discuss point Satchin,
talking one can move feeding window place
onto different

01:08:13 Shift Eating Window

period order happen, allow transition period
anywhere one week 10 days shift feeding window
hour day so. establish feeding window feels
comfortable think can maintain time, simply
maintain feeding schedule least 30 days, ideally
indefinitely. Now turns important based data gleaned
Circadian Clock massive experiment doing, people

surprising thing leap massive literature review time restricted feeding
humans relatively short feeding windows say four six hours produce

somebody interested deriving, many clearly established health effects

can comfortably manage, okay? Meaning average, can obey six hour


feeding window eight hour feeding window 10 hour feeding window.
place feeding window social life context can manage

Meaning people think eight hour feeding window six hour
feeding window, data analyzed, almost always case
actually feeding window one even two hours longer think
think, well, possibly people taking first bite noon
taking last bite 8:00 PM? Well, must mean
feeding window eight hours. turns people cheat, don't cheat
kind obvious way. might have, know, glass wine dinner,
cup tea little bite cookie. people honest
honest, cases experiment, find people's
eating window actually quite bit longer. discussing
reviewing literature, clear like 10 hour feeding window,
probably select eight hour feeding window, always little
bit taper either side eating window. people extremely strict
eating windows. just hard context life events social

slash time-restricted feeding schedule, now several different rules can
list first, least no food first hour waking least one hour, two, no


food intake two ideally three hours prior bedtime. Three, want
select eight hour feeding window, probably focus six seven
hour feeding window reality, feeding window going longer
reality, meaning real life constraints. like 10 hour feeding window,
probably select eight nine hour feeding window, way
plays people almost always eat outside eating window, somewhat.
nice thing selecting slightly shorter eating window comfortable
takes account take last bite last sip
calories, time taper before, actually fasted state.
eating different things different days, presumably foods leave

will discuss exceptions, people truly exceptions this.

00:59:30 4-6 Hour Feeding Windows

just require food. along lines, just now briefly want touch
studies looked using short feeding window four
hours, nowadays, number people so-called one meal per day,
restricting feeding window just four hours six hours. turns
interesting strategy data around actually little bit surprising. One
surprising thing leap massive literature review time restricted feeding
humans relatively short feeding windows say four six hours produce
number positive health effects. Things like increased insulin sensitivity,
know good, remember type two diabetes reduction insulin sensitivity
improvements beta cell function pancreas decreased blood pressure,
decreased oxidative stress decreases things like evening appetite. positive health
effects psychological facts general. However, either produce no change
body weight, tend produce even increases body weight, now, course
variation individuals studies, somewhat
surprising. eight hour feeding window seems beneficial across almost


parameters discussed, inflammation, weight, loss, fat loss, et cetera,
adherence. mention people's ability stick diet seems quite good
eight hour feeding windows, people try undergo short feeding
windows four six hours, seems overeating four six hours,
least overeating respect metabolic needs. Now, contrast so-
called one meal per day schedule, studies one meal per day, one meal per
day, unless very, long meal, sort feast typically not last four six
hours sort depends define meal. look
few, emphasize, again, studies one meal per day. People
typically maintain lose weight one meal per day schedule. can say
seven nine hour feeding window produces major health benefits
time-restricted feeding well pretty straightforward people adhere

point moment. Whereas four six hour eating window doesn't seem
serve people well say seven eight hour eating window, simply people
overeating eating window one meal per day, perhaps ideal
certain people's schedules may actually cause people under-eat.
cases might people want. actually want under-eat.
start thinking work sport, start considering hormone health

01:03:08 Protein Consumption & Timing Muscle

excellent studies this. explore now. talk
conditions feeding window early day actually
beneficial. study published recently Cell Reports, again,
Cell Press Journal, excellent journal peer reviewed, stringent, Aoyama, et al,
AOYAMA, et al. published just recently July, 2021 looked


distribution protein intake different meals delivered either early day
later day. summarizing quite lot, mention
study performed mice humans, paper, mice humans
involved hypertrophy training, essentially increasing weight bearing given limbs
try induce hypertrophy, growth muscle tissue. appear
muscle tissue better able undergo hypertrophy virtue fact
better enhanced protein synthesis early day, expression one
particular clock genes called BMAL, BMAL, BMAL regulates number
different protein synthesis pathways within muscle cells, eating protein early
day, supports muscle tissue maintenance growth. study, also
looked effects supplementing so-called BCAs branch chain amino acids,
popular bodybuilding circles strength training circles BCAs essential

takeaway study pretty straight forward. However, takeaway main
interest maintaining and, building muscle, can beneficial ingest protein

foundational rule no, not eating food first hour post waking least
first hour post. cutoff want eat protein sometime
10:00 AM. averaging across number different situations,
general, BMAL expression say wake 7:00 AM. main

60 minutes upon waking. Now not 10:01 gate slam shut can't
generate hypertrophy, course not case. However, interesting
doesn't matter resistance training, load bearing exercise occurs 24
hour cycle. whether not words, people training early day
training late day. still appears ingesting protein early day
favors hypertrophy one better, say easily able access
hypertrophy way clock, regulated protein synthesis mechanisms ingesting
protein early day, no way, shape form study say ingesting
protein later day somehow bad you? just emphasizes positive effects
ingesting protein early day sake muscle maintenance hypertrophy.
somebody mainly concerned muscle maintenance hypertrophy,


may make sense move feeding window earlier day. certainly
people interested muscle maintenance hypertrophy,
aren't intermittent fasting all, also perfectly fine, just
happens episode intermittent fasting time restricted feeding.
course, modes eating one eats small meals spread throughout day

00:59:30 4-6 Hour Feeding Windows

just require food. along lines, just now briefly want touch
studies looked using short feeding window four
hours, nowadays, number people so-called one meal per day,
restricting feeding window just four hours six hours. turns
interesting strategy data around actually little bit surprising. One
surprising thing leap massive literature review time restricted feeding
humans relatively short feeding windows say four six hours produce
number positive health effects. Things like increased insulin sensitivity,
know good, remember type two diabetes reduction insulin sensitivity
improvements beta cell function pancreas decreased blood pressure,
decreased oxidative stress decreases things like evening appetite. positive health

surprising. eight hour feeding window seems beneficial across almost


parameters discussed, inflammation, weight, loss, fat loss, et cetera,

eight hour feeding windows, people try undergo short feeding

least overeating respect metabolic needs. Now, contrast so-
called one meal per day schedule, studies one meal per day, one meal per

typically maintain lose weight one meal per day schedule. can say
seven nine hour feeding window produces major health benefits
time-restricted feeding well pretty straightforward people adhere

excellent studies this. explore now. talk

favors hypertrophy one better, say easily able access
hypertrophy way clock, regulated protein synthesis mechanisms ingesting

ingesting protein early day sake muscle maintenance hypertrophy.
somebody mainly concerned muscle maintenance hypertrophy,


may make sense move feeding window earlier day. certainly
people interested muscle maintenance hypertrophy,
aren't intermittent fasting all, also perfectly fine, just
happens episode intermittent fasting time restricted feeding.
course, modes eating one eats small meals spread throughout day
weights meals differently. meals early day larger later

somebody interested deriving, many clearly established health effects
time-restricted feeding, somebody like maintain build

least basis results. therefore eight hour window
established less ideal shifted later part day might not
beneficial you. Now can just personally say me. wake

ingesting protein early day sake muscle maintenance hypertrophy.
somebody mainly concerned muscle maintenance hypertrophy,


may make sense move feeding window earlier day. certainly
people interested muscle maintenance hypertrophy,
aren't intermittent fasting all, also perfectly fine, just
happens episode intermittent fasting time restricted feeding.
course, modes eating one eats small meals spread throughout day

somebody interested deriving, many clearly established health effects
time-restricted feeding, somebody like maintain build

Meaning people think eight hour feeding window six hour

00:59:30 4-6 Hour Feeding Windows

just require food. along lines, just now briefly want touch
studies looked using short feeding window four
hours, nowadays, number people so-called one meal per day,
restricting feeding window just four hours six hours. turns
interesting strategy data around actually little bit surprising. One
surprising thing leap massive literature review time restricted feeding
humans relatively short feeding windows say four six hours produce
number positive health effects. Things like increased insulin sensitivity,
know good, remember type two diabetes reduction insulin sensitivity
improvements beta cell function pancreas decreased blood pressure,
decreased oxidative stress decreases things like evening appetite. positive health
effects psychological facts general. However, either produce no change
body weight, tend produce even increases body weight, now, course
variation individuals studies, somewhat
surprising. eight hour feeding window seems beneficial across almost


parameters discussed, inflammation, weight, loss, fat loss, et cetera,
adherence. mention people's ability stick diet seems quite good
eight hour feeding windows, people try undergo short feeding
windows four six hours, seems overeating four six hours,
least overeating respect metabolic needs. Now, contrast so-
called one meal per day schedule, studies one meal per day, one meal per
day, unless very, long meal, sort feast typically not last four six
hours sort depends define meal. look
few, emphasize, again, studies one meal per day. People
typically maintain lose weight one meal per day schedule. can say
seven nine hour feeding window produces major health benefits
time-restricted feeding well pretty straightforward people adhere
regular basis regular basis, turns important. get back
point moment. Whereas four six hour eating window doesn't seem
serve people well say seven eight hour eating window, simply people
overeating eating window one meal per day, perhaps ideal
certain people's schedules may actually cause people under-eat.
cases might people want. actually want under-eat.
start thinking work sport, start considering hormone health

01:03:08 Protein Consumption & Timing Muscle

excellent studies this. explore now. talk
conditions feeding window early day actually
beneficial. study published recently Cell Reports, again,
Cell Press Journal, excellent journal peer reviewed, stringent, Aoyama, et al,
AOYAMA, et al. published just recently July, 2021 looked


distribution protein intake different meals delivered either early day
later day. summarizing quite lot, mention
study performed mice humans, paper, mice humans
involved hypertrophy training, essentially increasing weight bearing given limbs
try induce hypertrophy, growth muscle tissue. appear
muscle tissue better able undergo hypertrophy virtue fact
better enhanced protein synthesis early day, expression one
particular clock genes called BMAL, BMAL, BMAL regulates number
different protein synthesis pathways within muscle cells, eating protein early
day, supports muscle tissue maintenance growth. study, also
looked effects supplementing so-called BCAs branch chain amino acids,
popular bodybuilding circles strength training circles BCAs essential
components number different foods, can also supplemented.
takeaway study pretty straight forward. However, takeaway main
interest maintaining and, building muscle, can beneficial ingest protein
early day, still want obey this, calling kind
foundational rule no, not eating food first hour post waking least
first hour post. cutoff want eat protein sometime
10:00 AM. averaging across number different situations,
general, BMAL expression say wake 7:00 AM. main
interest hypertrophy maintenance muscle. want ingest
protein sometime 10:00 AM. obviously interested getting
health effects intermittent fasting, wouldn't ingest food least first
60 minutes upon waking. Now not 10:01 gate slam shut can't
generate hypertrophy, course not case. However, interesting
doesn't matter resistance training, load bearing exercise occurs 24
hour cycle. whether not words, people training early day
training late day. still appears ingesting protein early day
favors hypertrophy one better, say easily able access
hypertrophy way clock, regulated protein synthesis mechanisms ingesting
protein early day, no way, shape form study say ingesting
protein later day somehow bad you? just emphasizes positive effects
ingesting protein early day sake muscle maintenance hypertrophy.
somebody mainly concerned muscle maintenance hypertrophy,


may make sense move feeding window earlier day. certainly
people interested muscle maintenance hypertrophy,
aren't intermittent fasting all, also perfectly fine, just
happens episode intermittent fasting time restricted feeding.
course, modes eating one eats small meals spread throughout day
weights meals differently. meals early day larger later
day vice versa. near infinite number ways organize this.
somebody interested deriving, many clearly established health effects
time-restricted feeding, somebody like maintain build
muscle, ingesting proteins early part day important
least basis results. therefore eight hour window
established less ideal shifted later part day might not
beneficial you. Now can just personally say me. wake
morning, easy not eat noon one 2:00 PM. Eating early
day actually somewhat challenge. discuss point Satchin,
talking one can move feeding window place
onto different

01:08:13 Shift Eating Window

anywhere one week 10 days shift feeding window

comfortable think can maintain time, simply
maintain feeding schedule least 30 days, ideally
indefinitely. Now turns important based data gleaned
Circadian Clock massive experiment doing, people

extending still just eight hours. shifting around can cause
disruptions circadian clock mechanisms cause disruptions downstream
effects eating taking least two three days recover from. obviously
don't want overly neurotic stuff, episode
science intermittent fasting time restricted feeding, important long
feeding window is, feeding window resides 24 hour cycle.
perhaps even important fairly regular feeding

00:59:30 4-6 Hour Feeding Windows

just require food. along lines, just now briefly want touch
studies looked using short feeding window four
hours, nowadays, number people so-called one meal per day,
restricting feeding window just four hours six hours. turns
interesting strategy data around actually little bit surprising. One
surprising thing leap massive literature review time restricted feeding
humans relatively short feeding windows say four six hours produce
number positive health effects. Things like increased insulin sensitivity,
know good, remember type two diabetes reduction insulin sensitivity
improvements beta cell function pancreas decreased blood pressure,
decreased oxidative stress decreases things like evening appetite. positive health

eight hour feeding windows, people try undergo short feeding
windows four six hours, seems overeating four six hours,
least overeating respect metabolic needs. Now, contrast so-
called one meal per day schedule, studies one meal per day, one meal per

few, emphasize, again, studies one meal per day. People
typically maintain lose weight one meal per day schedule. can say
seven nine hour feeding window produces major health benefits
time-restricted feeding well pretty straightforward people adhere

favors hypertrophy one better, say easily able access
hypertrophy way clock, regulated protein synthesis mechanisms ingesting

ingesting protein early day sake muscle maintenance hypertrophy.
somebody mainly concerned muscle maintenance hypertrophy,


may make sense move feeding window earlier day. certainly
people interested muscle maintenance hypertrophy,
aren't intermittent fasting all, also perfectly fine, just
happens episode intermittent fasting time restricted feeding.
course, modes eating one eats small meals spread throughout day
weights meals differently. meals early day larger later
day vice versa. near infinite number ways organize this.
somebody interested deriving, many clearly established health effects
time-restricted feeding, somebody like maintain build
muscle, ingesting proteins early part day important
least basis results. therefore eight hour window
established less ideal shifted later part day might not
beneficial you. Now can just personally say me. wake
morning, easy not eat noon one 2:00 PM. Eating early
day actually somewhat challenge. discuss point Satchin,
talking one can move feeding window place
onto different

00:59:30 4-6 Hour Feeding Windows

just require food. along lines, just now briefly want touch
studies looked using short feeding window four
hours, nowadays, number people so-called one meal per day,
restricting feeding window just four hours six hours. turns
interesting strategy data around actually little bit surprising. One
surprising thing leap massive literature review time restricted feeding
humans relatively short feeding windows say four six hours produce
number positive health effects. Things like increased insulin sensitivity,
know good, remember type two diabetes reduction insulin sensitivity
improvements beta cell function pancreas decreased blood pressure,
decreased oxidative stress decreases things like evening appetite. positive health

variation individuals studies, somewhat
surprising. eight hour feeding window seems beneficial across almost

adherence. mention people's ability stick diet seems quite good
eight hour feeding windows, people try undergo short feeding
windows four six hours, seems overeating four six hours,
least overeating respect metabolic needs. Now, contrast so-
called one meal per day schedule, studies one meal per day, one meal per
day, unless very, long meal, sort feast typically not last four six
hours sort depends define meal. look
few, emphasize, again, studies one meal per day. People
typically maintain lose weight one meal per day schedule. can say
seven nine hour feeding window produces major health benefits
time-restricted feeding well pretty straightforward people adhere

01:03:08 Protein Consumption & Timing Muscle

excellent studies this. explore now. talk
conditions feeding window early day actually
beneficial. study published recently Cell Reports, again,
Cell Press Journal, excellent journal peer reviewed, stringent, Aoyama, et al,
AOYAMA, et al. published just recently July, 2021 looked


distribution protein intake different meals delivered either early day
later day. summarizing quite lot, mention
study performed mice humans, paper, mice humans

takeaway study pretty straight forward. However, takeaway main
interest maintaining and, building muscle, can beneficial ingest protein

foundational rule no, not eating food first hour post waking least
first hour post. cutoff want eat protein sometime
10:00 AM. averaging across number different situations,
general, BMAL expression say wake 7:00 AM. main
interest hypertrophy maintenance muscle. want ingest
protein sometime 10:00 AM. obviously interested getting
health effects intermittent fasting, wouldn't ingest food least first
60 minutes upon waking. Now not 10:01 gate slam shut can't
generate hypertrophy, course not case. However, interesting
doesn't matter resistance training, load bearing exercise occurs 24
hour cycle. whether not words, people training early day
training late day. still appears ingesting protein early day
favors hypertrophy one better, say easily able access
hypertrophy way clock, regulated protein synthesis mechanisms ingesting
protein early day, no way, shape form study say ingesting
protein later day somehow bad you? just emphasizes positive effects
ingesting protein early day sake muscle maintenance hypertrophy.
somebody mainly concerned muscle maintenance hypertrophy,


may make sense move feeding window earlier day. certainly
people interested muscle maintenance hypertrophy,
aren't intermittent fasting all, also perfectly fine, just
happens episode intermittent fasting time restricted feeding.
course, modes eating one eats small meals spread throughout day
weights meals differently. meals early day larger later
day vice versa. near infinite number ways organize this.
somebody interested deriving, many clearly established health effects
time-restricted feeding, somebody like maintain build
muscle, ingesting proteins early part day important
least basis results. therefore eight hour window
established less ideal shifted later part day might not
beneficial you. Now can just personally say me. wake
morning, easy not eat noon one 2:00 PM. Eating early
day actually somewhat challenge. discuss point Satchin,
talking one can move feeding window place
onto different

01:08:13 Shift Eating Window

anywhere one week 10 days shift feeding window
hour day so. establish feeding window feels
comfortable think can maintain time, simply
maintain feeding schedule least 30 days, ideally
indefinitely. Now turns important based data gleaned
Circadian Clock massive experiment doing, people
entering times feeding and, eating. Excuse me, anytime talk

particular weekends, people either extending shifting feeding window
way makes seem traveled another time zone eating

Saturday, becoming 11:00 ending early, perhaps
starting early day Sunday, brunch starts nine 30 10,
extending still just eight hours. shifting around can cause
disruptions circadian clock mechanisms cause disruptions downstream
effects eating taking least two three days recover from. obviously
don't want overly neurotic stuff, episode
science intermittent fasting time restricted feeding, important long
feeding window is, feeding window resides 24 hour cycle.
perhaps even important fairly regular feeding
window resides. even short feeding window, drifting
around day day, actually offsets number positive health effects

indeed does, clearing glucose system can accomplished

However, can accelerate considerably taking 20 30 minute just light

wouldn't necessarily want immediately eating. take look
high-intensity training kind blood glucose, case, turns
high intensity training actually opposite effects blood

repeating long high intensity interval training course will also vary.
brief, know, six 12 15 minute workouts. people
can carry high intensity interval training 45 maybe even 60 minutes
extreme cases. look studies explored high intensity
interval training effect blood glucose, couple studies leap
out, instance, one emphasized blood glucose levels will actually increase
high intensity interval training performed early day will decrease high
intensity interval training performed later day. Now purpose
exploration not explore clearance blood glucose sake intermittent fasting.
mainly focused athletic performance whether not better early

somebody mainly concerned muscle maintenance hypertrophy,


may make sense move feeding window earlier day. certainly
people interested muscle maintenance hypertrophy,
aren't intermittent fasting all, also perfectly fine, just
happens episode intermittent fasting time restricted feeding.
course, modes eating one eats small meals spread throughout day

somebody interested deriving, many clearly established health effects
time-restricted feeding, somebody like maintain build

eight hour feeding window, want provide little basis it. just
encourage not completely arbitrary. lengthy review mentioned
earlier, features number studies used eight hour feeding window,
particular study like highlight mainly don't expect people

study carried humans entitled effects eight hour time restricted
feeding body weight metabolic disease, risk factors obese adults, excuse me.
study essentially showed, just read conclusions eight hour time
restricted feeding produces mild caloric restriction weight loss without calorie
counting, key, right? people aren't calorie counting somehow just
adhering eight hour window. taking fewer calories burning
off clinically reduced blood pressure. mentioned study, not
aren't many others involving eight hour feeding window also humans,
eight hour feeding window tested obese adults non obese adults.
even studies children. eight hour window seems
really good rule

know, think like many people decide, well, know, exactly half?
like another wrong croissant? kind thing. don't negotiate food.
like time restricted feeding window. know going eat for, case,
use 10 hour feeding window so, eat whole croissant. just don't

immediately understand eating not eating not equivalent

something breaks fast not. Now technical way go
wear continuous glucose monitor ingest little bits food, different kinds
large amounts food, different kinds measure blood glucose, ultimately
blood glucose readout whether not system fed fasted state.
parameters too, course, dominant one far
scientific literature says drinking water will not break fast drinking tea will not break
fast drinking coffee, provided black coffee will not break fast ingesting
caffeine pill form will not break fast. things won't break

eating whole handful peanuts might not even break fast low

large meal kind hour ago, yes, indeed, eating one peanut break
fast. contextual, really important understand, unless
going wear continuous glucose monitor. unless going wear
continuous glucose monitor set absolute numerical threshold

anything involves sugar particular, simple sugars can potentially break fast.
actually study this, shows people ingest even one, one
gram sugar post dinner, full meal dinner can actually disrupt

something breaks fast not. Now technical way go
wear continuous glucose monitor ingest little bits food, different kinds
large amounts food, different kinds measure blood glucose, ultimately
blood glucose readout whether not system fed fasted state.
parameters too, course, dominant one far
scientific literature says drinking water will not break fast drinking tea will not break
fast drinking coffee, provided black coffee will not break fast ingesting
caffeine pill form will not break fast. things won't break

eating whole handful peanuts might not even break fast low

anything involves sugar particular, simple sugars can potentially break fast.
actually study this, shows people ingest even one, one

scientific literature says drinking water will not break fast drinking tea will not break

scientific literature says drinking water will not break fast drinking tea will not break

scientific literature says drinking water will not break fast drinking tea will not break
fast drinking coffee, provided black coffee will not break fast ingesting

anything involves sugar particular, simple sugars can potentially break fast.

scientific literature says drinking water will not break fast drinking tea will not break
fast drinking coffee, provided black coffee will not break fast ingesting

fasting incomplete without discussion not
break fast. However, no black white answer question,
immediately understand eating not eating not equivalent
fed fasted. depends ate much ate
circadian cycle. can actually arrive simple answer whether not
something breaks fast not. Now technical way go
wear continuous glucose monitor ingest little bits food, different kinds
large amounts food, different kinds measure blood glucose, ultimately
blood glucose readout whether not system fed fasted state.
parameters too, course, dominant one far
scientific literature says drinking water will not break fast drinking tea will not break
fast drinking coffee, provided black coffee will not break fast ingesting
caffeine pill form will not break fast. things won't break
fast. instance, eating one peanut deep fasted state will not break fast,
eating whole handful peanuts might not even break fast low
glucose state. However, just finished meal included carbohydrates,
large meal kind hour ago, yes, indeed, eating one peanut break
fast. contextual, really important understand, unless
going wear continuous glucose monitor. unless going wear
continuous glucose monitor set absolute numerical threshold
break fast. think simple rules can follow. First all,
anything involves sugar particular, simple sugars can potentially break fast.
actually study this, shows people ingest even one, one
gram sugar post dinner, full meal dinner can actually disrupt
expression circadian genes related fasting sleep sleep
related fasting. Now pretty extreme, almost kind scary think about,
sensitive system is. already somewhat elevated blood glucose

high intensity training, haven't quite reached beginning so-called


feeding window, will eating small amount food take us fast? Well,
depends food is. mostly fat, probably not, number people
nowadays talk so-called fat fasting, fat fasting way kind regal past

called MCTs, people will ingest fats official feeding window begins.

fat will tend blunt rise glucose will extend duration
glucose released. really can't say food X beverage X breaks fast, however,
extremes, can say that, instance, drink can soda pop, unless
just ran ultra marathon, breaking fast, okay, eat piece pizza,

wear continuous glucose monitor ingest little bits food, different kinds
large amounts food, different kinds measure blood glucose, ultimately
blood glucose readout whether not system fed fasted state.
parameters too, course, dominant one far
scientific literature says drinking water will not break fast drinking tea will not break
fast drinking coffee, provided black coffee will not break fast ingesting
caffeine pill form will not break fast. things won't break

eating whole handful peanuts might not even break fast low

anything involves sugar particular, simple sugars can potentially break fast.
actually study this, shows people ingest even one, one

01:53:15 Breaks Fast? Rules & Context

significant portion weight one loses body fat stores. discussion
fasting incomplete without discussion not
break fast. However, no black white answer question,
immediately understand eating not eating not equivalent
fed fasted. depends ate much ate
circadian cycle. can actually arrive simple answer whether not
something breaks fast not. Now technical way go
wear continuous glucose monitor ingest little bits food, different kinds
large amounts food, different kinds measure blood glucose, ultimately
blood glucose readout whether not system fed fasted state.
parameters too, course, dominant one far
scientific literature says drinking water will not break fast drinking tea will not break
fast drinking coffee, provided black coffee will not break fast ingesting
caffeine pill form will not break fast. things won't break
fast. instance, eating one peanut deep fasted state will not break fast,
eating whole handful peanuts might not even break fast low
glucose state. However, just finished meal included carbohydrates,
large meal kind hour ago, yes, indeed, eating one peanut break
fast. contextual, really important understand, unless
going wear continuous glucose monitor. unless going wear
continuous glucose monitor set absolute numerical threshold
break fast. think simple rules can follow. First all,
anything involves sugar particular, simple sugars can potentially break fast.
actually study this, shows people ingest even one, one
gram sugar post dinner, full meal dinner can actually disrupt
expression circadian genes related fasting sleep sleep
related fasting. Now pretty extreme, almost kind scary think about,
sensitive system is. already somewhat elevated blood glucose
meal ate hour ago, whereas run hour train hard,
high intensity training, haven't quite reached beginning so-called


feeding window, will eating small amount food take us fast? Well,
depends food is. mostly fat, probably not, number people
nowadays talk so-called fat fasting, fat fasting way kind regal past
stringency either eating not eating black white rule feeding window
versus non feeding window. people will ingest medium chain triglycerides so-
called MCTs, people will ingest fats official feeding window begins.
sort negotiations people carry tend go. course
won't increase blood glucose insulin much carbohydrates will, protein will
sort intermediate effect. mentioned earlier, ingesting carbohydrates
fat will tend blunt rise glucose will extend duration
glucose released. really can't say food X beverage X breaks fast, however,
extremes, can say that, instance, drink can soda pop, unless
just ran ultra marathon, breaking fast, okay, eat piece pizza,
breaking fast, eat purely fats, maybe, probably not. fasting
five hours strictly fasting five hours more. can start see
lot wiggle room contextual. posts
see information see something not break fast,
doesn't place context last time ate ate

established, eat vitally important, probably
wondering whether not artificial sweeteners non artificial plant-based sweeteners
like Stevia break fast, will vary somewhat. say data
somewhat mixed. evidence people ingest artificial sweeteners,
can create transient increase blood glucose followed transient decrease
blood glucose baseline. thought explain increase hunger caused
ingestion things like aspartame sucralose things sort. not
lot good studies exploring plant-based non sugar sweeteners, things like Stevia,
even things like monk fruit, separate category unto itself. aren't lot
studies this. think people need establish themselves. best way
course, wear continuous glucose monitor go fasted state
either one hour two hours, maybe fasting night ingest
Stevia whatever form want coffee whatever form want sucralose
aspartame, et cetera, setting aside discussion effects things
gut microbiome, different topic entirely. think fair say
moderation, plant-based non sugar sweeteners like Stevia particular, Stevia
seemed minimal impact overall blood glucose considered fairly
large time aspartame, sucralose, saccharin. think can say less
same, soon get discussion those, also get
discussion evidence published nature excellent
journals now pointing fact consumed excess, not consumed
moderation, consumed excess might detrimental
effects gut microbiome. artificial sweeteners break fast? depends
amount depends type. general, think probably okay provided
not indulging often, however, people just virtue tasting
something sweet, feel spike appetite makes harder adhere
feeding window. can imagine really well controlled
study hard carry out. not really sure worth
tax dollars actually design carry study like
much individual variation terms discipline adhering feeding window,
whether not people experience increases drops blood glucose,
impacts them, whether not exercising. just becomes infinite variable
space, say, experimental science. really determine you,


don't think can fairly say artificial sweeteners break fast.

02:01:42 Glucose Clearing II, Cinnamon, Acidity, Salt

think incorrect say earlier, talking glucose disposal
agents, behavioral compound based things like Metformin berberine,
fact, cinnamon even mild glucose disposal agent. can actually reduce blood
glucose, lemon lime juice, believe not, can lower blood glucose. may
experienced eating something very, sweet almost feeling kind
overwhelming poisoned sweet is, especially not accustomed
eating lot sugary things. One quick remedy actually half lime half
lemon squeezed juice drinking just virtue taste virtue
fact will reduce blood glucose. notice effect almost immediately

number things can adjust blood glucose, not necessarily
disposal agents, not sweeping bloodstream way
berberine Metformin would, high intensity exercise appropriate times
day would. one particular thing one can ingest can help manage
psychologically performance wise fasting portion intermittent
fasting get feeding window. salt. talked little bit
podcast before, neurons use salt, sodium potassium
magnesium, so-called electrolytes order perform magic chemical
electrical signaling, everything depends chemical, electrical signaling
chemical electrical signaling requires electrolytes form another
neurons run passage ions like sodium cell membranes are,
say, across cell membranes accurate. Many people find kind
lightheadedness, shakiness accustomed slightly low blood sugar
can offset taking half teaspoon sea salt, even just tiny pinch salt
putting water drinking it. people find glucose
lowering effects acidity, feeling kind shaky not well, put
lemon juice water drink drops blood glucose further.
common practice nowadays discussed internet waking drinking
water lime lemon juice little pinch salt. think little
pinch salt good idea. doing, offsetting this? Well, salt water


actually mild effect glucose disposal agent, stabilizing effect
blood volume. so, sodium brings water so-called osmolarity

Many people find feeling shaky. feeling lightheaded. can't

may may not include lemon lime juice. immediately feel better find
actually quite straightforward get that, wait feeding window

ingest caffeine, actually excrete lot water, diarrhetic effect.
water goes salt. actually causes excrete sodium. Now role sodium

absolutely will. demonstrated based one gram sugar,

actually spikes high meal. tends drop back baseline
even slightly baseline afterwards, talk people this, somebody said,
oh, got continuous glucose monitor getting disrupted heat
sauna. actually not case. Turns go sauna,
dehydrate, losing water, wasn't drinking water dropping lot
water. concentration sugar blood actually goes up. actually put

personally, psychological physical health effects sauna valuable
enough continue use it. just not concerned increase blood

02:01:42 Glucose Clearing II, Cinnamon, Acidity, Salt

lemon juice water drink drops blood glucose further.
common practice nowadays discussed internet waking drinking

even slightly baseline afterwards, talk people this, somebody said,
oh, got continuous glucose monitor getting disrupted heat
sauna. actually not case. Turns go sauna,
dehydrate, losing water, wasn't drinking water dropping lot

willing eat. totally separate manner eat.
established, eat vitally important, probably
wondering whether not artificial sweeteners non artificial plant-based sweeteners
like Stevia break fast, will vary somewhat. say data
somewhat mixed. evidence people ingest artificial sweeteners,
can create transient increase blood glucose followed transient decrease
blood glucose baseline. thought explain increase hunger caused
ingestion things like aspartame sucralose things sort. not
lot good studies exploring plant-based non sugar sweeteners, things like Stevia,
even things like monk fruit, separate category unto itself. aren't lot
studies this. think people need establish themselves. best way
course, wear continuous glucose monitor go fasted state
either one hour two hours, maybe fasting night ingest
Stevia whatever form want coffee whatever form want sucralose
aspartame, et cetera, setting aside discussion effects things
gut microbiome, different topic entirely. think fair say
moderation, plant-based non sugar sweeteners like Stevia particular, Stevia
seemed minimal impact overall blood glucose considered fairly
large time aspartame, sucralose, saccharin. think can say less
same, soon get discussion those, also get
discussion evidence published nature excellent
journals now pointing fact consumed excess, not consumed
moderation, consumed excess might detrimental
effects gut microbiome. artificial sweeteners break fast? depends
amount depends type. general, think probably okay provided
not indulging often, however, people just virtue tasting
something sweet, feel spike appetite makes harder adhere
feeding window. can imagine really well controlled
study hard carry out. not really sure worth
tax dollars actually design carry study like
much individual variation terms discipline adhering feeding window,
whether not people experience increases drops blood glucose,
impacts them, whether not exercising. just becomes infinite variable
space, say, experimental science. really determine you,


don't think can fairly say artificial sweeteners break fast.

02:01:42 Glucose Clearing II, Cinnamon, Acidity, Salt

think incorrect say earlier, talking glucose disposal
agents, behavioral compound based things like Metformin berberine,
fact, cinnamon even mild glucose disposal agent. can actually reduce blood
glucose, lemon lime juice, believe not, can lower blood glucose. may
experienced eating something very, sweet almost feeling kind
overwhelming poisoned sweet is, especially not accustomed
eating lot sugary things. One quick remedy actually half lime half
lemon squeezed juice drinking just virtue taste virtue
fact will reduce blood glucose. notice effect almost immediately
disappears, not magic. effects acidity blood glucose levels.
number things can adjust blood glucose, not necessarily
disposal agents, not sweeping bloodstream way
berberine Metformin would, high intensity exercise appropriate times
day would. one particular thing one can ingest can help manage
psychologically performance wise fasting portion intermittent
fasting get feeding window. salt. talked little bit
podcast before, neurons use salt, sodium potassium
magnesium, so-called electrolytes order perform magic chemical
electrical signaling, everything depends chemical, electrical signaling
chemical electrical signaling requires electrolytes form another
neurons run passage ions like sodium cell membranes are,
say, across cell membranes accurate. Many people find kind
lightheadedness, shakiness accustomed slightly low blood sugar
can offset taking half teaspoon sea salt, even just tiny pinch salt
putting water drinking it. people find glucose
lowering effects acidity, feeling kind shaky not well, put
lemon juice water drink drops blood glucose further.
common practice nowadays discussed internet waking drinking
water lime lemon juice little pinch salt. think little
pinch salt good idea. doing, offsetting this? Well, salt water


actually mild effect glucose disposal agent, stabilizing effect
blood volume. so, sodium brings water so-called osmolarity
blood body depends salt levels blood brain body.
Many people find feeling shaky. feeling lightheaded. can't
concentrate. think need sugar food, will actually remedy
salt. know number people incorporated practice
written saying, oh, know, just take little bit salt water,
may may not include lemon lime juice. immediately feel better find
actually quite straightforward get that, wait feeding window
kicks in. especially true people using caffeine
ingest caffeine, actually excrete lot water, diarrhetic effect.
water goes salt. actually causes excrete sodium. Now role sodium
blood pressure hypertension is, know, quite controversial science magazine,
one premier scientific journals special issue salt
years ago, talking research around hypertension, indeed people chronic
hypertension high blood pressure high blood pressure particular
wary ingesting much sodium. people ingesting sodium provided
drink enough water don't chronic hypertension high blood pressure
actually beneficial. Now doesn't mean drinking seawater doesn't
mean overindulging salt, many people find can manage

fine. just drinking water, maybe lemon lime juice

couple things place category frequently asked
somewhat odd, still worthy discussion. instance, people asked will
brushing teeth toothpaste, break fast? think unless swallowing
toothpaste, no. Now really want run get continuous glucose monitor
brush teeth, can evaluate that, no people asked will half
glass wine dinner couple hours dinner break fast. Absolutely.
absolutely will. demonstrated based one gram sugar,
kind eerie scary effect talked before, scary eerie, just
seems like one gram sugar. that?



02:09:23 Effects Sauna & Dehydration Blood Glucose

metabolic processes sensitive, post-meal, months
back, experiment wearing continuous glucose monitor. got surprise
discovered going sauna increases blood glucose quite bit.
actually spikes high meal. tends drop back baseline
even slightly baseline afterwards, talk people this, somebody said,
oh, got continuous glucose monitor getting disrupted heat
sauna. actually not case. Turns go sauna,
dehydrate, losing water, wasn't drinking water dropping lot
water. concentration sugar blood actually goes up. actually put
data social media post Twitter, people kind shocked see
much sauna can spike blood glucose, now practice time, restricted
feeding, intermittent fasting. not super strict it. use kind eight 10 hour
ish window either early day late day. saw effect sauna,
personally, psychological physical health effects sauna valuable
enough continue use it. just not concerned increase blood
glucose, extent going eliminate sauna. like use sauna three
four times week sleep, use hour two sleep. yes, indeed
creates big spike blood glucose drops based change
concentration blood sugar. just not going worry it, now,
concerned blood glucose spikes, might worried it,
case, one things interesting worthy discussion.
thought somewhat surprising me, although makes perfect sense
case,

02:11:12 Ideal Fasting Protocol

end day, literally, just makes sense get sauna. Okay.
now heard lot science. heard lot examples, even

special cases people can't adhere one meal per day type
schedule, least not regular basis. not compatible social
schedules. Although people may able adhere straightforward
way, aren't robust studies exploring advantages one meal per day.
feel advantages one meal per day opposed eight
hour feeding window, well means, use one meal per day approach use
four six hour feeding window just make sure don't overeat window.
Remember people tend not adhere eight hour feeding window,
say eight hours, tend eat outside eight hours little bit side,
goal 10 hour feeding window, might want set nine hours eight

feel advantages one meal per day opposed eight

four six hour feeding window just make sure don't overeat window.
Remember people tend not adhere eight hour feeding window,
say eight hours, tend eat outside eight hours little bit side,

people genuinely need eat. certainly not want see people getting
