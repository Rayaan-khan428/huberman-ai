name suggests, OCD includes thoughts obsessions compulsions
actions. obsessions compulsions often linked. fact, time,
obsessions compulsions linked compulsion, behavior,
designed relieve obsession. However, one hallmark themes obsessive-
compulsive disorder obsessions intrusive. People don't want
them. don't enjoy them. just seem pop people's minds
seem pop mind recurrently. compulsions, unlike sorts
behaviors, provide brief relief obsession, quickly reinforce
strengthen obsession. key theme realize obsessive-
compulsive disorder just going repeat again. two features, first, fact
obsessions intrusive recurrent, well fact compulsions,
behaviors, provide, anything, brief relief obsessions, cases
simply serve make obsessions stronger hallmark features obsessive-
compulsive disorder. turns important keep mind
go forward, not just define obsessive-compulsive disorder, also
define sorts treatments will will not work obsessive-compulsive
disorder. understand little bit neural circuitry underlying
obsessive-compulsive disorder, talk moments, will
clearly understand quote-unquote, obsessive person obsessive-
compulsive personality not OCD. fact, can leap ahead little bit
compare contrast OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder along
one particular set features. Again, go detail later, fair
say OCD characterized recurrent intrusive obsessions.
mentioned before, fact obsessions get stronger function people
performing certain behaviors. unlike itch feel, scratch
feels better, OCD like itch feel, scratch it, itch
intensifies. contour pattern behaviors thoughts interacting
different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, mainly involves sense
delayed gratification people want somewhat enjoy allows
function better line like show world. again,
OCD mainly obsessions intrusive recurrent, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder not intrusive feature it.


People not mind, fact,

00:11:18 OCD: Major Incidence & Severity

often invite like particular patterns thought lead compulsive
along certain dimensions. leaving aside obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
moment, focus bit OCD define tends show
world. First all, OCD extremely common. fact, current estimates
anywhere 2.5% high 3 even 4% people suffer true OCD,
astonishingly high number. Now, reason range big, 2.5% way
3, maybe even 4%, lot features OCD go unnoticed
clinician's office simply people don't report don't talk it. fact,
possible recurrent intrusive obsessions not engage sorts
behaviors ever allow people notice somebody OCD. can
intrusive thoughts don't actually lead overt behaviors like hand
washing checking people notice. can also people learn
disguise hide obsessions compulsions shame fear
looking strange whatever might obsessive
intrusive thoughts, little micro-behaviors like might tap fingers
thigh way avoid, least mind, something catastrophic
happening. might seem crazy you, might seem bizarre, sort
thing operates lot people. really want emphasize
clinical literature really point fact many people OCD,
full blown OCD, never report kind shame hiding associated
it. Another thing point OCD extremely debilitating. mentioned
minutes ago, OCD currently listed number seven terms
debilitating illnesses, not just mental illnesses disorders, types illnesses
including things like asthma cancer, et cetera. can imagine
standing number seven, extremely common extremely debilitating.
consequence, now realized many hours, days, weeks, months, even
years work performance showing work relational interactions really suffer
consequence people OCD. vital problem scientific
psychiatric psychological communities understand. one reasons
podcast. course, received ton interest OCD


incredibly high incidence OCD debilitating is. go really deep
debilitating. don't want spend much time think
pretty obvious, not. instance, one things
makes OCD debilitating is, course, shame talked before.
also fact people focusing obsessions compulsions,
not able focus things. simply way brain works.
not able focus many things once. thing OCD takes
lot time people's lives. recurrent intrusive thoughts happening high
frequency, even moderate frequency, people spending lot time thinking
stuff thinking behaviors need engage in,
engaging behaviors, mentioned before, just serve strengthen
compulsions not actually things make us
functional human beings like commuting work homework work
listening people talking interacting sports working out, things
make rich quality life taken OCD many cases.
might obvious some, not sure obvious everybody just much time
OCD can occupy. Another thing soon learn sadly,

00:15:10 Categories OCD

lot obsessions compulsions OCD often relate taboo topics.
general categories OCD fall three different bins, checking
obsessions compulsions, repetition obsessions compulsions, order
obsessions compulsions. checking ones somewhat obvious, checking
stove checking locks, think tend do. somebody typically
head off car commute work think, lock front door, go
back once, won't go back twice 50 times. People OCD will often go back 20
30 times actually allow drive off. real
challenge continue drive off discard idea didn't
check stove didn't check locks didn't check something else
critical. Repetition obsessions compulsions, obviously can dovetail
checking ones, tend things like counting off certain number
numbers, like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
People perform repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, feel to.


remember years ago watching documentary band, Ramones, right?
people heard Ramones, right? Jeans, T-shirts, aviator glasses, everyone
change last name Ramone. weren't actually related one
another, way. change last name Ramone. Ramones
one band member admittedly known others OCD.
documentary, forget name, think called, can't remember,
anyway, can't remember, hippocampal lapse there, documentary, band
members describe Joey Ramone leaving hotels, walking stairs
parking lot, walk seven eight times,
sometimes getting van walking seven eight
times always certain number times, given certain number stairs.
appears, quote-unquote, crazy, course, don't want think
crazy. somebody likely full blown OCD. Now particular
example, believe not, not uncommon. just happens example
entailed certain compulsions behaviors overt people
see. can imagine prevent somebody moving
daily life easily. lot people, mentioned before, obsessions
compulsions hide little micro behaviors, just count
off head opposed generating sort walking downstairs
tapping things sort. checking, repetition,
order. Order oftentimes thought putting cleanliness making sure everything
aligned perfect orderly. oftentimes case,
forms order people OCD can focus obsessive compulsive way.
Things like incompleteness, idea one can't walk away something stop
something something's not right complete picture.
way table set. way something's written page.
email. Again, now still talking OCD, disorder. not talking
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. aware of, well, just direct,
several colleagues mine just remarkable, order emails. Every email
perfect, punctuated, perfect, grammar, perfect, everything's spaced perfect.
OCD? Well, might, might not. know unless disclose
me. might obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, just might
able generate lot order lot discipline around way
write, way present communication anybody all. somebody


OCD domain order, incompleteness constant
feeling something not completed need complete it. can also
terms symmetry, everything aligned symmetric way.
seen perhaps young kids. one example read literature children
need arrange stuffed animals exact order every day
particular order point move little stuffed frog next
stuffed rabbit, child anxiety reaction feel literally
compelled, driven fix maybe even multiple times again. talk
OCD children versus adults little bit. aspect order,
little bit less intuitive, notion disgust, idea something
contaminated. often think OCD hand washing behavior response
people feeling something contaminated, space, towel, et cetera, even
simply somebody else's hand unwilling shake somebody's hand.
can imagine different bins obsessions compulsions, checking
repetition order extremely debilitating depending severe
many different domains life show in. oftentimes movies
even way describing now sounds if, okay, well somebody check
locks don't also check stove, somebody need count
seven back forth seven seven seven times seven times day
something sort need symmetry specific domains life.
turns recurrent intrusive aspect obsessions leads people OCD
checking repetition and/or order compulsions everywhere. whether not
somebody work school trying engage sport trying engage
relationship just something simple like walking street, obsessions
intrusive show compel people things domain
independent whether not happen one location another.
words, thought patterns behaviors take environment opposed
environment driving thought patterns behaviors. therefore becomes
impossible ever find room clean enough, find bed made well
enough, find anything done well enough remove obsession. know
said multiple times now, going say many times throughout episode
somewhat obsessive, believe justified way every time one engages
compulsion related obsession, obsession simply becomes stronger.



00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions

can imagine powerful debilitating loop really is. drill
little bit deeper obsessions compulsions relate one another.
draw line obsessions compulsions, line
described anxiety. Now, need define anxiety quite honest,
psychology science can't agree exactly anxiety is. Typically way
think fear heightened state autonomic arousal, increased
heart rate, increased breathing, sweating, et cetera, response immediate
present threat perceived threat. Whereas anxiety, generally speaking scientific
literature, relates sorts thought patterns somatic bodily responses,
heart rate, breathing, et cetera, without clear present danger
environment right there. way going talk anxiety now.
anxiety really binds obsessions compulsions someone will
intrusive thought. instance, someone will thought
turn left street, something bad will happen. Okay, obsession.
actually not uncommon. Now, bad specificity bad thing
really will vary. people will think, turn left, something generally bad will
happen, just makes feel anxious, always insist going right. Whereas
people will think turn left, will die, will die, something terrible
will happen, get disease someone else will get disease cursing
somebody else specific way. unfortunately quite common
people OCD. feeling feeling can generally
specifically related particular outcome. beneath feeling anxiety,
quickening heartbeat, quickening breathing, narrowing one's visual focus.
talked another podcast, Master Stress, another podcast
haven't heard those, let just briefly describe state
increased so-called autonomic arousal, alertness, stress, et cetera, visual field
literally narrows, aperture visual field gets smaller
relationship autonomic nervous system visual system, start
seeing world sort soda straw view binocular-like view,
opposed seeing big picture. important? Well, literally sharpens
narrows focus toward thing obsessions compulsions
focused on. person walking street sees opportunity go left


right will see bad decision, visual field narrows tightly along
possibility taking left turn. know describe seems totally irrational,
want emphasize person OCD knows irrational. might feel crazy
thoughts, know makes no sense whatsoever
left somehow different right terms outcomes particular
case, yet feels would. fact, cases feels went left,
full blown panic attack. idea obsessions
compulsions bound anxiety, taking right-hand turn, again,
one particular example, taking right-hand turn, brief, mention,
brief relief anxiety time decision go right, not left
additional drop anxiety one takes right-hand turn opposed left-
hand turn. alluded before, reinforcement compulsion.
words, going right, doesn't create situation brain psychology
person that, oh, know what, not anxious anymore, left would've probably
okay. reinforces idea right made feel better, turning right made
feel better, going left would've much worse. Again, reinforces
obsession even further. again, swap right turns left turns
something like hand washing, feeling something contaminated need
wash one's hands even though one already washed hands 20, 30, 50 times prior.
actually going go back example little bit later talk
one particular category therapies effective many people OCD
cognitive behavioral exposure therapies. think
heard cognitive behavioral exposure therapies, way used treat
OCD much different way used treat sorts anxiety
disorders sorts disorders generally. fair say 70%
people OCD sort anxiety elevated anxiety, either directly related
OCD indirectly related OCD really hard tease apart
OCD can create anxiety, mentioned before, can even increase
anxiety. also issue depression. OCD can
depressing, especially OCD thoughts behaviors start really
impede people's ability function life. work, school, relationship, can
start feeling less optimistic life. fact, people can become suicidally
depressed. bad OCD can us. careful saying
70% people OCD also anxiety X number people OCD


also depressed don't know whether not depression led OCD
way around whether not operating, say science,
parallel. drug treatments OCD depression anxiety can tease
apart talk that, think fair say binds
obsessions compulsions anxiety, feeling of, say
urgent feeling need get rid obsession. person feels
way

00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity

can engage particular compulsive behavior. people
probably wondering genetic component OCD indeed is, although
nature isn't exactly clear. oftentimes people hear something
genetic component, think always directly inherited parent, not
always case. can genes surface siblings genes surface
children not readily apparent terms call phenotype.
genotype, gene, phenotype, way shows body
form like eye color shows terms behavior behavioral pattern.
Based twin studies researchers examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
even identical twins share sack utero, call monochorionic,
sitting little bag pregnancy different little bags, can see
different levels called genetic concordance. just sort cut
broad swath genetic data, fair say 40 50% OCD
cases genetic component, mutation inherited aspect
genetic one point got genome mapped. Now,
interesting, don't think terribly useful people. First all, can't really
control genes, least point history, even though things like
epigenetic control people excited technologies like CRISPR
modifying genome humans point, people can't control genetics,
right? can't pick parents say.

00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops

just know genetic component half people OCD, not


always. Now typical podcast, want focus neural
mechanisms chemical systems brain body generate obsessive-
compulsive disorder. fact, watched podcast before, listen podcast
before, always structure things. First, introduce topic explore
topic detail really define isn't.
important focus known not known biological
mechanisms generate whatever thing happens be, case, OCD
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Now want emphasize even
don't background biology, will make information accessible you.
also want emphasize interested treatments
anxiously awaiting description things can help OCD, encourage you,
will, please try digest material underlying mechanisms
understanding even just little bit biological mechanisms can really
help shed light particular drug behavioral treatments sorts
treatments work don't work. especially important case OCD
turns order type treatment can really vary according individual,
something really special important OCD really can't say
number sorts disorders described previous podcasts.
take step back look neural circuitry. going brain
body people OCD? intrusive recurrent thoughts? compulsions?
whole system bound anxiety? ways thinking that,
want keep mind brain two main functions. brain's main
functions take care housekeeping stuff, make sure digestion works,
make sure heart beats, make sure keep breathing no matter what, make sure
can see, can hear, can smell, et cetera, basic stuff,
enormous amount brain real estate designed allow predict
going happen next, either immediate future long-term future.
largely done based knowledge past. also memory
systems. course systems brain body designed
bind happening housekeeping level, like heart rate,
anticipation going happen next. thinking something
fearful, body will one type reaction. thinking something
pleasant relaxing, body will another type reaction. whenever hear
brain-body distinction, just remind everybody really no


distinction brain body think nervous system.
nervous system brain, eyes, spinal cord, course
connections organs body connections organs
body brain, spinal cord, et cetera. describe neural circuits,
don't want think just things happening head, certainly
happening head, fact, circuits described detail exist within
confines cranial vault, nerd speak skull, circuits driving
particular predictions therefore particular biases towards particular actions
body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate
information allowed pass conscious experience,
not. gating mechanism strongly regulated chemical GABA. GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, say, serves shut suppress
activity neurons. thalamic reticular nucleus really saying, no, touch

might also think smells room seeing hearing.
can combine different sensory modalities, thalamic reticular nucleus
really allows us funnel, direct particular categories sensory experience
conscious awareness suppress categories sensory experience. addition,
thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass
conscious perception ones not, much
neuroscientists indeed neurophilosophers, want call that,
theorized philosophized thalamic reticular nucleus actually involved
consciousness. Now, consciousness isn't topic really want talk
episode kind mushy-murky, say science, shmooey term
doesn't really clear definitions arguments often get lost
fact people arguing different things. say consciousness,
mean conscious awareness. zoom take look circuit
got now know based neuroimaging studies intimately involved
generating obsessions compulsions OCD. cortex neocortex,
involved perception understanding happening. striatum
basal ganglia, involved generating behaviors, go, suppressing
behaviors, no-go. thalamus collects sensory

can pass can pass through, you, you, can't pass

00:39:36 Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loop & OCD

know circuit involved OCD? Well there, can look
really interesting studies involve bringing human subjects laboratory

going exhaustive way. wouldn't want anyone self-diagnose. Although
hoping sharing this, might get insight whether
not obsessions compulsions might qualify OCD, perhaps
even seek help. commonly used test OCD, OCD, say,
called Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. is, scientists love
acronyms military, Y-BOCS, Y-B-O-C-S, Y-BOCS.
typically someone will go clinic either family member encouraged

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. SSRI? SSRI drug prevents re-uptake

relieve OCD significant degree. know that? gave
Y-BOCS test talked before, Yale-Brown test questions
read few. OCD severity one Y-BOCS

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least

homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship

GABA transmission altered net effect overall reduction GABA.
Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just
confess, first all, don't OCD, although will also confess
child, transient tick. talked podcast before. grunting
tick. six seven, recall trip Washington DC family,
feeling strong desire need even recall, grunt order clear
something throat, didn't anything throat. didn't cold
postnasal drip, really just feeling needed that, release sort
tension. remember dad time telling don't that. Don't that,
not good grunt something like that. think saw kind compulsive

hide room. Fortunately me, transient, think six months year
later, disappeared. Although notice, actually ex-girlfriend mine point

never diagnosed Tourette's. OCD? Maybe. certainly accused
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, talk still
minutes. point many children transiently express ticks low level
Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol
explored bunch different contexts, including ticks OCD, et cetera.
Going back inositol current use, say current use,
taking 900 milligrams inositol addition existing toolkit sleep,

taking 900 milligrams myo-inositol either alone combination sleep kit.
must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem
lead enhanced levels focus alertness day. perhaps
noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects
experiments actually stop taking inositol gastric discomfort gastric
distress called. reported results sleep kind anecdotal way.
certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating
supplement protocol. think great future nutraceuticals, meaning
think systematic exploration particular lower dosages context OCD
treatment. saw SSRIs prescription drug treatments,
think really needs exploration nutraceuticals combination
behavioral therapies.

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing

name suggests, OCD includes thoughts obsessions compulsions
actions. obsessions compulsions often linked. fact, time,
obsessions compulsions linked compulsion, behavior,
designed relieve obsession. However, one hallmark themes obsessive-
compulsive disorder obsessions intrusive. People don't want
them. don't enjoy them. just seem pop people's minds
seem pop mind recurrently. compulsions, unlike sorts
behaviors, provide brief relief obsession, quickly reinforce
strengthen obsession. key theme realize obsessive-
compulsive disorder just going repeat again. two features, first, fact
obsessions intrusive recurrent, well fact compulsions,
behaviors, provide, anything, brief relief obsessions, cases
simply serve make obsessions stronger hallmark features obsessive-
compulsive disorder. turns important keep mind
go forward, not just define obsessive-compulsive disorder, also
define sorts treatments will will not work obsessive-compulsive
disorder. understand little bit neural circuitry underlying
obsessive-compulsive disorder, talk moments, will
clearly understand quote-unquote, obsessive person obsessive-
compulsive personality not OCD. fact, can leap ahead little bit
compare contrast OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder along
one particular set features. Again, go detail later, fair
say OCD characterized recurrent intrusive obsessions.
mentioned before, fact obsessions get stronger function people
performing certain behaviors. unlike itch feel, scratch
feels better, OCD like itch feel, scratch it, itch
intensifies. contour pattern behaviors thoughts interacting
different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, mainly involves sense
delayed gratification people want somewhat enjoy allows
function better line like show world. again,
OCD mainly obsessions intrusive recurrent, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder not intrusive feature it.


People not mind, fact,

00:11:18 OCD: Major Incidence & Severity

often invite like particular patterns thought lead compulsive
along certain dimensions. leaving aside obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
moment, focus bit OCD define tends show
world. First all, OCD extremely common. fact, current estimates
anywhere 2.5% high 3 even 4% people suffer true OCD,
astonishingly high number. Now, reason range big, 2.5% way
3, maybe even 4%, lot features OCD go unnoticed
clinician's office simply people don't report don't talk it. fact,
possible recurrent intrusive obsessions not engage sorts
behaviors ever allow people notice somebody OCD. can
intrusive thoughts don't actually lead overt behaviors like hand
washing checking people notice. can also people learn
disguise hide obsessions compulsions shame fear
looking strange whatever might obsessive
intrusive thoughts, little micro-behaviors like might tap fingers
thigh way avoid, least mind, something catastrophic
happening. might seem crazy you, might seem bizarre, sort
thing operates lot people. really want emphasize
clinical literature really point fact many people OCD,
full blown OCD, never report kind shame hiding associated
it. Another thing point OCD extremely debilitating. mentioned
minutes ago, OCD currently listed number seven terms
debilitating illnesses, not just mental illnesses disorders, types illnesses
including things like asthma cancer, et cetera. can imagine
standing number seven, extremely common extremely debilitating.
consequence, now realized many hours, days, weeks, months, even
years work performance showing work relational interactions really suffer
consequence people OCD. vital problem scientific
psychiatric psychological communities understand. one reasons
podcast. course, received ton interest OCD


incredibly high incidence OCD debilitating is. go really deep
debilitating. don't want spend much time think
pretty obvious, not. instance, one things
makes OCD debilitating is, course, shame talked before.
also fact people focusing obsessions compulsions,
not able focus things. simply way brain works.
not able focus many things once. thing OCD takes
lot time people's lives. recurrent intrusive thoughts happening high
frequency, even moderate frequency, people spending lot time thinking
stuff thinking behaviors need engage in,
engaging behaviors, mentioned before, just serve strengthen
compulsions not actually things make us
functional human beings like commuting work homework work
listening people talking interacting sports working out, things
make rich quality life taken OCD many cases.
might obvious some, not sure obvious everybody just much time
OCD can occupy. Another thing soon learn sadly,

00:15:10 Categories OCD

lot obsessions compulsions OCD often relate taboo topics.
general categories OCD fall three different bins, checking
obsessions compulsions, repetition obsessions compulsions, order
obsessions compulsions. checking ones somewhat obvious, checking
stove checking locks, think tend do. somebody typically
head off car commute work think, lock front door, go
back once, won't go back twice 50 times. People OCD will often go back 20
30 times actually allow drive off. real
challenge continue drive off discard idea didn't
check stove didn't check locks didn't check something else
critical. Repetition obsessions compulsions, obviously can dovetail
checking ones, tend things like counting off certain number
numbers, like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
People perform repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, feel to.


remember years ago watching documentary band, Ramones, right?
people heard Ramones, right? Jeans, T-shirts, aviator glasses, everyone
change last name Ramone. weren't actually related one
another, way. change last name Ramone. Ramones
one band member admittedly known others OCD.
documentary, forget name, think called, can't remember,
anyway, can't remember, hippocampal lapse there, documentary, band
members describe Joey Ramone leaving hotels, walking stairs
parking lot, walk seven eight times,
sometimes getting van walking seven eight
times always certain number times, given certain number stairs.

OCD children versus adults little bit. aspect order,
little bit less intuitive, notion disgust, idea something

people feeling something contaminated, space, towel, et cetera, even
simply somebody else's hand unwilling shake somebody's hand.
can imagine different bins obsessions compulsions, checking
repetition order extremely debilitating depending severe
many different domains life show in. oftentimes movies
even way describing now sounds if, okay, well somebody check
locks don't also check stove, somebody need count

turns recurrent intrusive aspect obsessions leads people OCD

words, thought patterns behaviors take environment opposed
environment driving thought patterns behaviors. therefore becomes
impossible ever find room clean enough, find bed made well

said multiple times now, going say many times throughout episode
somewhat obsessive, believe justified way every time one engages
compulsion related obsession, obsession simply becomes stronger.



00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions

can imagine powerful debilitating loop really is. drill
little bit deeper obsessions compulsions relate one another.
draw line obsessions compulsions, line
described anxiety. Now, need define anxiety quite honest,
psychology science can't agree exactly anxiety is. Typically way
think fear heightened state autonomic arousal, increased
heart rate, increased breathing, sweating, et cetera, response immediate
present threat perceived threat. Whereas anxiety, generally speaking scientific
literature, relates sorts thought patterns somatic bodily responses,
heart rate, breathing, et cetera, without clear present danger
environment right there. way going talk anxiety now.
anxiety really binds obsessions compulsions someone will
intrusive thought. instance, someone will thought
turn left street, something bad will happen. Okay, obsession.
actually not uncommon. Now, bad specificity bad thing
really will vary. people will think, turn left, something generally bad will
happen, just makes feel anxious, always insist going right. Whereas
people will think turn left, will die, will die, something terrible
will happen, get disease someone else will get disease cursing
somebody else specific way. unfortunately quite common
people OCD. feeling feeling can generally
specifically related particular outcome. beneath feeling anxiety,
quickening heartbeat, quickening breathing, narrowing one's visual focus.
talked another podcast, Master Stress, another podcast
haven't heard those, let just briefly describe state
increased so-called autonomic arousal, alertness, stress, et cetera, visual field
literally narrows, aperture visual field gets smaller
relationship autonomic nervous system visual system, start
seeing world sort soda straw view binocular-like view,
opposed seeing big picture. important? Well, literally sharpens
narrows focus toward thing obsessions compulsions
focused on. person walking street sees opportunity go left


right will see bad decision, visual field narrows tightly along
possibility taking left turn. know describe seems totally irrational,
want emphasize person OCD knows irrational. might feel crazy
thoughts, know makes no sense whatsoever
left somehow different right terms outcomes particular
case, yet feels would. fact, cases feels went left,
full blown panic attack. idea obsessions
compulsions bound anxiety, taking right-hand turn, again,
one particular example, taking right-hand turn, brief, mention,
brief relief anxiety time decision go right, not left
additional drop anxiety one takes right-hand turn opposed left-
hand turn. alluded before, reinforcement compulsion.
words, going right, doesn't create situation brain psychology
person that, oh, know what, not anxious anymore, left would've probably
okay. reinforces idea right made feel better, turning right made
feel better, going left would've much worse. Again, reinforces
obsession even further. again, swap right turns left turns
something like hand washing, feeling something contaminated need
wash one's hands even though one already washed hands 20, 30, 50 times prior.
actually going go back example little bit later talk
one particular category therapies effective many people OCD
cognitive behavioral exposure therapies. think
heard cognitive behavioral exposure therapies, way used treat
OCD much different way used treat sorts anxiety
disorders sorts disorders generally. fair say 70%
people OCD sort anxiety elevated anxiety, either directly related
OCD indirectly related OCD really hard tease apart
OCD can create anxiety, mentioned before, can even increase
anxiety. also issue depression. OCD can
depressing, especially OCD thoughts behaviors start really
impede people's ability function life. work, school, relationship, can
start feeling less optimistic life. fact, people can become suicidally
depressed. bad OCD can us. careful saying
70% people OCD also anxiety X number people OCD


also depressed don't know whether not depression led OCD
way around whether not operating, say science,
parallel. drug treatments OCD depression anxiety can tease
apart talk that, think fair say binds
obsessions compulsions anxiety, feeling of, say
urgent feeling need get rid obsession. person feels
way

00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity

can engage particular compulsive behavior. people
probably wondering genetic component OCD indeed is, although
nature isn't exactly clear. oftentimes people hear something
genetic component, think always directly inherited parent, not
always case. can genes surface siblings genes surface
children not readily apparent terms call phenotype.
genotype, gene, phenotype, way shows body
form like eye color shows terms behavior behavioral pattern.
Based twin studies researchers examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
even identical twins share sack utero, call monochorionic,
sitting little bag pregnancy different little bags, can see
different levels called genetic concordance. just sort cut
broad swath genetic data, fair say 40 50% OCD
cases genetic component, mutation inherited aspect
genetic one point got genome mapped. Now,
interesting, don't think terribly useful people. First all, can't really
control genes, least point history, even though things like
epigenetic control people excited technologies like CRISPR
modifying genome humans point, people can't control genetics,
right? can't pick parents say.

00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops

just know genetic component half people OCD, not


always. Now typical podcast, want focus neural
mechanisms chemical systems brain body generate obsessive-
compulsive disorder. fact, watched podcast before, listen podcast
before, always structure things. First, introduce topic explore
topic detail really define isn't.
important focus known not known biological
mechanisms generate whatever thing happens be, case, OCD
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Now want emphasize even
don't background biology, will make information accessible you.
also want emphasize interested treatments
anxiously awaiting description things can help OCD, encourage you,
will, please try digest material underlying mechanisms
understanding even just little bit biological mechanisms can really
help shed light particular drug behavioral treatments sorts
treatments work don't work. especially important case OCD
turns order type treatment can really vary according individual,
something really special important OCD really can't say
number sorts disorders described previous podcasts.
take step back look neural circuitry. going brain
body people OCD? intrusive recurrent thoughts? compulsions?
whole system bound anxiety? ways thinking that,
want keep mind brain two main functions. brain's main
functions take care housekeeping stuff, make sure digestion works,
make sure heart beats, make sure keep breathing no matter what, make sure
can see, can hear, can smell, et cetera, basic stuff,
enormous amount brain real estate designed allow predict
going happen next, either immediate future long-term future.
largely done based knowledge past. also memory
systems. course systems brain body designed
bind happening housekeeping level, like heart rate,
anticipation going happen next. thinking something
fearful, body will one type reaction. thinking something
pleasant relaxing, body will another type reaction. whenever hear
brain-body distinction, just remind everybody really no


distinction brain body think nervous system.
nervous system brain, eyes, spinal cord, course
connections organs body connections organs
body brain, spinal cord, et cetera. describe neural circuits,
don't want think just things happening head, certainly
happening head, fact, circuits described detail exist within
confines cranial vault, nerd speak skull, circuits driving
particular predictions therefore particular biases towards particular actions
body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate
information allowed pass conscious experience,
not. gating mechanism strongly regulated chemical GABA. GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, say, serves shut suppress

might also think smells room seeing hearing.
can combine different sensory modalities, thalamic reticular nucleus
really allows us funnel, direct particular categories sensory experience
conscious awareness suppress categories sensory experience. addition,
thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass
conscious perception ones not, much
neuroscientists indeed neurophilosophers, want call that,
theorized philosophized thalamic reticular nucleus actually involved
consciousness. Now, consciousness isn't topic really want talk
episode kind mushy-murky, say science, shmooey term
doesn't really clear definitions arguments often get lost
fact people arguing different things. say consciousness,
mean conscious awareness. zoom take look circuit
got now know based neuroimaging studies intimately involved

involved perception understanding happening. striatum
basal ganglia, involved generating behaviors, go, suppressing
behaviors, no-go. thalamus collects sensory

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least
study, tell study is, Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005

combine them? Well, explored well, combination cognitive

cognitive behavioral, slash, exposure therapy done way detailed before,

fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.
alleviate OCD symptoms everybody? No. time consuming? Yes. Twice
week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

serotonin depleted humans low levels serotonin,
can see evidence cognitive inflexibility, challenges tasks, switching challenges

OCD. Again, one starts explore different transmitter systems
explored animal models humans, vast, vast landscape,
serotonergic drugs seem effective drugs treating OCD despite
fact, again, despite fact no direct evidence serotonin systems
problem OCD. recall cortico-striatal-thalamic loop central

actually say cognitive behavioral therapy taps serotonin system,
clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also
show reductions cortico-striatal-thalamic loops. basically situation
behavioral therapy works, many people, not all,
pretty good understanding works. increases anxiety tolerance,

week, cognitive behavioral sessions, taking SSRI 10 12
weeks,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive

great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young

physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just

Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol

Going back inositol current use, say current use,

No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.

high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,

interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

name suggests, OCD includes thoughts obsessions compulsions
actions. obsessions compulsions often linked. fact, time,
obsessions compulsions linked compulsion, behavior,
designed relieve obsession. However, one hallmark themes obsessive-
compulsive disorder obsessions intrusive. People don't want
them. don't enjoy them. just seem pop people's minds
seem pop mind recurrently. compulsions, unlike sorts
behaviors, provide brief relief obsession, quickly reinforce
strengthen obsession. key theme realize obsessive-
compulsive disorder just going repeat again. two features, first, fact
obsessions intrusive recurrent, well fact compulsions,
behaviors, provide, anything, brief relief obsessions, cases
simply serve make obsessions stronger hallmark features obsessive-
compulsive disorder. turns important keep mind
go forward, not just define obsessive-compulsive disorder, also
define sorts treatments will will not work obsessive-compulsive
disorder. understand little bit neural circuitry underlying
obsessive-compulsive disorder, talk moments, will
clearly understand quote-unquote, obsessive person obsessive-
compulsive personality not OCD. fact, can leap ahead little bit
compare contrast OCD obsessive-compulsive personality disorder along
one particular set features. Again, go detail later, fair
say OCD characterized recurrent intrusive obsessions.
mentioned before, fact obsessions get stronger function people
performing certain behaviors. unlike itch feel, scratch
feels better, OCD like itch feel, scratch it, itch
intensifies. contour pattern behaviors thoughts interacting
different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, mainly involves sense
delayed gratification people want somewhat enjoy allows
function better line like show world. again,
OCD mainly obsessions intrusive recurrent, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder not intrusive feature it.


People not mind, fact,

00:11:18 OCD: Major Incidence & Severity

often invite like particular patterns thought lead compulsive
along certain dimensions. leaving aside obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
moment, focus bit OCD define tends show
world. First all, OCD extremely common. fact, current estimates
anywhere 2.5% high 3 even 4% people suffer true OCD,
astonishingly high number. Now, reason range big, 2.5% way
3, maybe even 4%, lot features OCD go unnoticed
clinician's office simply people don't report don't talk it. fact,
possible recurrent intrusive obsessions not engage sorts
behaviors ever allow people notice somebody OCD. can
intrusive thoughts don't actually lead overt behaviors like hand
washing checking people notice. can also people learn
disguise hide obsessions compulsions shame fear
looking strange whatever might obsessive
intrusive thoughts, little micro-behaviors like might tap fingers
thigh way avoid, least mind, something catastrophic
happening. might seem crazy you, might seem bizarre, sort
thing operates lot people. really want emphasize
clinical literature really point fact many people OCD,
full blown OCD, never report kind shame hiding associated
it. Another thing point OCD extremely debilitating. mentioned
minutes ago, OCD currently listed number seven terms
debilitating illnesses, not just mental illnesses disorders, types illnesses
including things like asthma cancer, et cetera. can imagine
standing number seven, extremely common extremely debilitating.
consequence, now realized many hours, days, weeks, months, even
years work performance showing work relational interactions really suffer
consequence people OCD. vital problem scientific
psychiatric psychological communities understand. one reasons
podcast. course, received ton interest OCD


incredibly high incidence OCD debilitating is. go really deep
debilitating. don't want spend much time think
pretty obvious, not. instance, one things
makes OCD debilitating is, course, shame talked before.
also fact people focusing obsessions compulsions,
not able focus things. simply way brain works.
not able focus many things once. thing OCD takes
lot time people's lives. recurrent intrusive thoughts happening high
frequency, even moderate frequency, people spending lot time thinking
stuff thinking behaviors need engage in,
engaging behaviors, mentioned before, just serve strengthen
compulsions not actually things make us
functional human beings like commuting work homework work
listening people talking interacting sports working out, things
make rich quality life taken OCD many cases.
might obvious some, not sure obvious everybody just much time
OCD can occupy. Another thing soon learn sadly,

00:15:10 Categories OCD

lot obsessions compulsions OCD often relate taboo topics.
general categories OCD fall three different bins, checking
obsessions compulsions, repetition obsessions compulsions, order
obsessions compulsions. checking ones somewhat obvious, checking
stove checking locks, think tend do. somebody typically
head off car commute work think, lock front door, go
back once, won't go back twice 50 times. People OCD will often go back 20
30 times actually allow drive off. real
challenge continue drive off discard idea didn't
check stove didn't check locks didn't check something else
critical. Repetition obsessions compulsions, obviously can dovetail
checking ones, tend things like counting off certain number
numbers, like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
People perform repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, feel to.


remember years ago watching documentary band, Ramones, right?
people heard Ramones, right? Jeans, T-shirts, aviator glasses, everyone
change last name Ramone. weren't actually related one
another, way. change last name Ramone. Ramones
one band member admittedly known others OCD.
documentary, forget name, think called, can't remember,
anyway, can't remember, hippocampal lapse there, documentary, band
members describe Joey Ramone leaving hotels, walking stairs
parking lot, walk seven eight times,
sometimes getting van walking seven eight
times always certain number times, given certain number stairs.
appears, quote-unquote, crazy, course, don't want think
crazy. somebody likely full blown OCD. Now particular
example, believe not, not uncommon. just happens example
entailed certain compulsions behaviors overt people
see. can imagine prevent somebody moving
daily life easily. lot people, mentioned before, obsessions
compulsions hide little micro behaviors, just count
off head opposed generating sort walking downstairs
tapping things sort. checking, repetition,
order. Order oftentimes thought putting cleanliness making sure everything
aligned perfect orderly. oftentimes case,
forms order people OCD can focus obsessive compulsive way.
Things like incompleteness, idea one can't walk away something stop
something something's not right complete picture.
way table set. way something's written page.
email. Again, now still talking OCD, disorder. not talking
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. aware of, well, just direct,
several colleagues mine just remarkable, order emails. Every email
perfect, punctuated, perfect, grammar, perfect, everything's spaced perfect.
OCD? Well, might, might not. know unless disclose
me. might obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, just might
able generate lot order lot discipline around way
write, way present communication anybody all. somebody


OCD domain order, incompleteness constant
feeling something not completed need complete it. can also
terms symmetry, everything aligned symmetric way.
seen perhaps young kids. one example read literature children
need arrange stuffed animals exact order every day
particular order point move little stuffed frog next
stuffed rabbit, child anxiety reaction feel literally
compelled, driven fix maybe even multiple times again. talk
OCD children versus adults little bit. aspect order,
little bit less intuitive, notion disgust, idea something
contaminated. often think OCD hand washing behavior response
people feeling something contaminated, space, towel, et cetera, even
simply somebody else's hand unwilling shake somebody's hand.
can imagine different bins obsessions compulsions, checking
repetition order extremely debilitating depending severe
many different domains life show in. oftentimes movies
even way describing now sounds if, okay, well somebody check
locks don't also check stove, somebody need count
seven back forth seven seven seven times seven times day
something sort need symmetry specific domains life.
turns recurrent intrusive aspect obsessions leads people OCD
checking repetition and/or order compulsions everywhere. whether not
somebody work school trying engage sport trying engage
relationship just something simple like walking street, obsessions
intrusive show compel people things domain
independent whether not happen one location another.
words, thought patterns behaviors take environment opposed
environment driving thought patterns behaviors. therefore becomes
impossible ever find room clean enough, find bed made well
enough, find anything done well enough remove obsession. know
said multiple times now, going say many times throughout episode
somewhat obsessive, believe justified way every time one engages
compulsion related obsession, obsession simply becomes stronger.



00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions

can imagine powerful debilitating loop really is. drill
little bit deeper obsessions compulsions relate one another.
draw line obsessions compulsions, line
described anxiety. Now, need define anxiety quite honest,
psychology science can't agree exactly anxiety is. Typically way
think fear heightened state autonomic arousal, increased
heart rate, increased breathing, sweating, et cetera, response immediate
present threat perceived threat. Whereas anxiety, generally speaking scientific
literature, relates sorts thought patterns somatic bodily responses,
heart rate, breathing, et cetera, without clear present danger
environment right there. way going talk anxiety now.
anxiety really binds obsessions compulsions someone will
intrusive thought. instance, someone will thought
turn left street, something bad will happen. Okay, obsession.
actually not uncommon. Now, bad specificity bad thing
really will vary. people will think, turn left, something generally bad will
happen, just makes feel anxious, always insist going right. Whereas
people will think turn left, will die, will die, something terrible
will happen, get disease someone else will get disease cursing
somebody else specific way. unfortunately quite common
people OCD. feeling feeling can generally
specifically related particular outcome. beneath feeling anxiety,
quickening heartbeat, quickening breathing, narrowing one's visual focus.
talked another podcast, Master Stress, another podcast
haven't heard those, let just briefly describe state
increased so-called autonomic arousal, alertness, stress, et cetera, visual field
literally narrows, aperture visual field gets smaller
relationship autonomic nervous system visual system, start
seeing world sort soda straw view binocular-like view,
opposed seeing big picture. important? Well, literally sharpens
narrows focus toward thing obsessions compulsions
focused on. person walking street sees opportunity go left


right will see bad decision, visual field narrows tightly along
possibility taking left turn. know describe seems totally irrational,
want emphasize person OCD knows irrational. might feel crazy
thoughts, know makes no sense whatsoever
left somehow different right terms outcomes particular
case, yet feels would. fact, cases feels went left,
full blown panic attack. idea obsessions
compulsions bound anxiety, taking right-hand turn, again,
one particular example, taking right-hand turn, brief, mention,
brief relief anxiety time decision go right, not left
additional drop anxiety one takes right-hand turn opposed left-
hand turn. alluded before, reinforcement compulsion.
words, going right, doesn't create situation brain psychology
person that, oh, know what, not anxious anymore, left would've probably
okay. reinforces idea right made feel better, turning right made
feel better, going left would've much worse. Again, reinforces
obsession even further. again, swap right turns left turns
something like hand washing, feeling something contaminated need
wash one's hands even though one already washed hands 20, 30, 50 times prior.
actually going go back example little bit later talk
one particular category therapies effective many people OCD
cognitive behavioral exposure therapies. think
heard cognitive behavioral exposure therapies, way used treat
OCD much different way used treat sorts anxiety
disorders sorts disorders generally. fair say 70%
people OCD sort anxiety elevated anxiety, either directly related
OCD indirectly related OCD really hard tease apart
OCD can create anxiety, mentioned before, can even increase
anxiety. also issue depression. OCD can
depressing, especially OCD thoughts behaviors start really
impede people's ability function life. work, school, relationship, can
start feeling less optimistic life. fact, people can become suicidally
depressed. bad OCD can us. careful saying
70% people OCD also anxiety X number people OCD


also depressed don't know whether not depression led OCD
way around whether not operating, say science,
parallel. drug treatments OCD depression anxiety can tease
apart talk that, think fair say binds
obsessions compulsions anxiety, feeling of, say
urgent feeling need get rid obsession. person feels
way

00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity

can engage particular compulsive behavior. people
probably wondering genetic component OCD indeed is, although
nature isn't exactly clear. oftentimes people hear something
genetic component, think always directly inherited parent, not
always case. can genes surface siblings genes surface
children not readily apparent terms call phenotype.
genotype, gene, phenotype, way shows body
form like eye color shows terms behavior behavioral pattern.
Based twin studies researchers examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
even identical twins share sack utero, call monochorionic,
sitting little bag pregnancy different little bags, can see
different levels called genetic concordance. just sort cut
broad swath genetic data, fair say 40 50% OCD
cases genetic component, mutation inherited aspect
genetic one point got genome mapped. Now,
interesting, don't think terribly useful people. First all, can't really
control genes, least point history, even though things like
epigenetic control people excited technologies like CRISPR
modifying genome humans point, people can't control genetics,
right? can't pick parents say.

00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops

just know genetic component half people OCD, not


always. Now typical podcast, want focus neural
mechanisms chemical systems brain body generate obsessive-
compulsive disorder. fact, watched podcast before, listen podcast
before, always structure things. First, introduce topic explore
topic detail really define isn't.
important focus known not known biological
mechanisms generate whatever thing happens be, case, OCD
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Now want emphasize even
don't background biology, will make information accessible you.
also want emphasize interested treatments
anxiously awaiting description things can help OCD, encourage you,
will, please try digest material underlying mechanisms
understanding even just little bit biological mechanisms can really

lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,

nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain

loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy

striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves

Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments

interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD

progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms

describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist

treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive

reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic

people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation

increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,

treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment

People not mind, fact,

00:11:18 OCD: Major Incidence & Severity

often invite like particular patterns thought lead compulsive
along certain dimensions. leaving aside obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
moment, focus bit OCD define tends show
world. First all, OCD extremely common. fact, current estimates
anywhere 2.5% high 3 even 4% people suffer true OCD,
astonishingly high number. Now, reason range big, 2.5% way
3, maybe even 4%, lot features OCD go unnoticed
clinician's office simply people don't report don't talk it. fact,
possible recurrent intrusive obsessions not engage sorts
behaviors ever allow people notice somebody OCD. can
intrusive thoughts don't actually lead overt behaviors like hand
washing checking people notice. can also people learn
disguise hide obsessions compulsions shame fear
looking strange whatever might obsessive
intrusive thoughts, little micro-behaviors like might tap fingers
thigh way avoid, least mind, something catastrophic
happening. might seem crazy you, might seem bizarre, sort
thing operates lot people. really want emphasize
clinical literature really point fact many people OCD,
full blown OCD, never report kind shame hiding associated
it. Another thing point OCD extremely debilitating. mentioned
minutes ago, OCD currently listed number seven terms
debilitating illnesses, not just mental illnesses disorders, types illnesses
including things like asthma cancer, et cetera. can imagine
standing number seven, extremely common extremely debilitating.
consequence, now realized many hours, days, weeks, months, even
years work performance showing work relational interactions really suffer
consequence people OCD. vital problem scientific
psychiatric psychological communities understand. one reasons
podcast. course, received ton interest OCD


incredibly high incidence OCD debilitating is. go really deep
debilitating. don't want spend much time think
pretty obvious, not. instance, one things
makes OCD debilitating is, course, shame talked before.
also fact people focusing obsessions compulsions,
not able focus things. simply way brain works.
not able focus many things once. thing OCD takes
lot time people's lives. recurrent intrusive thoughts happening high
frequency, even moderate frequency, people spending lot time thinking
stuff thinking behaviors need engage in,
engaging behaviors, mentioned before, just serve strengthen
compulsions not actually things make us
functional human beings like commuting work homework work
listening people talking interacting sports working out, things
make rich quality life taken OCD many cases.
might obvious some, not sure obvious everybody just much time
OCD can occupy. Another thing soon learn sadly,

00:15:10 Categories OCD

lot obsessions compulsions OCD often relate taboo topics.
general categories OCD fall three different bins, checking
obsessions compulsions, repetition obsessions compulsions, order
obsessions compulsions. checking ones somewhat obvious, checking
stove checking locks, think tend do. somebody typically
head off car commute work think, lock front door, go
back once, won't go back twice 50 times. People OCD will often go back 20
30 times actually allow drive off. real
challenge continue drive off discard idea didn't
check stove didn't check locks didn't check something else
critical. Repetition obsessions compulsions, obviously can dovetail
checking ones, tend things like counting off certain number
numbers, like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
People perform repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, feel to.


remember years ago watching documentary band, Ramones, right?
people heard Ramones, right? Jeans, T-shirts, aviator glasses, everyone
change last name Ramone. weren't actually related one
another, way. change last name Ramone. Ramones
one band member admittedly known others OCD.
documentary, forget name, think called, can't remember,
anyway, can't remember, hippocampal lapse there, documentary, band
members describe Joey Ramone leaving hotels, walking stairs
parking lot, walk seven eight times,
sometimes getting van walking seven eight
times always certain number times, given certain number stairs.
appears, quote-unquote, crazy, course, don't want think
crazy. somebody likely full blown OCD. Now particular
example, believe not, not uncommon. just happens example
entailed certain compulsions behaviors overt people
see. can imagine prevent somebody moving
daily life easily. lot people, mentioned before, obsessions
compulsions hide little micro behaviors, just count
off head opposed generating sort walking downstairs
tapping things sort. checking, repetition,
order. Order oftentimes thought putting cleanliness making sure everything
aligned perfect orderly. oftentimes case,
forms order people OCD can focus obsessive compulsive way.
Things like incompleteness, idea one can't walk away something stop
something something's not right complete picture.
way table set. way something's written page.
email. Again, now still talking OCD, disorder. not talking
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. aware of, well, just direct,
several colleagues mine just remarkable, order emails. Every email
perfect, punctuated, perfect, grammar, perfect, everything's spaced perfect.
OCD? Well, might, might not. know unless disclose
me. might obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, just might
able generate lot order lot discipline around way
write, way present communication anybody all. somebody


OCD domain order, incompleteness constant
feeling something not completed need complete it. can also
terms symmetry, everything aligned symmetric way.
seen perhaps young kids. one example read literature children
need arrange stuffed animals exact order every day
particular order point move little stuffed frog next
stuffed rabbit, child anxiety reaction feel literally
compelled, driven fix maybe even multiple times again. talk
OCD children versus adults little bit. aspect order,
little bit less intuitive, notion disgust, idea something
contaminated. often think OCD hand washing behavior response
people feeling something contaminated, space, towel, et cetera, even
simply somebody else's hand unwilling shake somebody's hand.
can imagine different bins obsessions compulsions, checking
repetition order extremely debilitating depending severe
many different domains life show in. oftentimes movies
even way describing now sounds if, okay, well somebody check
locks don't also check stove, somebody need count
seven back forth seven seven seven times seven times day
something sort need symmetry specific domains life.
turns recurrent intrusive aspect obsessions leads people OCD
checking repetition and/or order compulsions everywhere. whether not
somebody work school trying engage sport trying engage
relationship just something simple like walking street, obsessions
intrusive show compel people things domain
independent whether not happen one location another.
words, thought patterns behaviors take environment opposed
environment driving thought patterns behaviors. therefore becomes
impossible ever find room clean enough, find bed made well
enough, find anything done well enough remove obsession. know
said multiple times now, going say many times throughout episode
somewhat obsessive, believe justified way every time one engages
compulsion related obsession, obsession simply becomes stronger.



00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions

can imagine powerful debilitating loop really is. drill
little bit deeper obsessions compulsions relate one another.
draw line obsessions compulsions, line
described anxiety. Now, need define anxiety quite honest,
psychology science can't agree exactly anxiety is. Typically way
think fear heightened state autonomic arousal, increased
heart rate, increased breathing, sweating, et cetera, response immediate
present threat perceived threat. Whereas anxiety, generally speaking scientific
literature, relates sorts thought patterns somatic bodily responses,
heart rate, breathing, et cetera, without clear present danger
environment right there. way going talk anxiety now.
anxiety really binds obsessions compulsions someone will
intrusive thought. instance, someone will thought
turn left street, something bad will happen. Okay, obsession.
actually not uncommon. Now, bad specificity bad thing
really will vary. people will think, turn left, something generally bad will
happen, just makes feel anxious, always insist going right. Whereas
people will think turn left, will die, will die, something terrible
will happen, get disease someone else will get disease cursing
somebody else specific way. unfortunately quite common
people OCD. feeling feeling can generally
specifically related particular outcome. beneath feeling anxiety,
quickening heartbeat, quickening breathing, narrowing one's visual focus.
talked another podcast, Master Stress, another podcast
haven't heard those, let just briefly describe state
increased so-called autonomic arousal, alertness, stress, et cetera, visual field
literally narrows, aperture visual field gets smaller
relationship autonomic nervous system visual system, start
seeing world sort soda straw view binocular-like view,
opposed seeing big picture. important? Well, literally sharpens
narrows focus toward thing obsessions compulsions
focused on. person walking street sees opportunity go left


right will see bad decision, visual field narrows tightly along
possibility taking left turn. know describe seems totally irrational,
want emphasize person OCD knows irrational. might feel crazy
thoughts, know makes no sense whatsoever
left somehow different right terms outcomes particular
case, yet feels would. fact, cases feels went left,
full blown panic attack. idea obsessions
compulsions bound anxiety, taking right-hand turn, again,
one particular example, taking right-hand turn, brief, mention,
brief relief anxiety time decision go right, not left
additional drop anxiety one takes right-hand turn opposed left-
hand turn. alluded before, reinforcement compulsion.
words, going right, doesn't create situation brain psychology
person that, oh, know what, not anxious anymore, left would've probably
okay. reinforces idea right made feel better, turning right made
feel better, going left would've much worse. Again, reinforces
obsession even further. again, swap right turns left turns
something like hand washing, feeling something contaminated need
wash one's hands even though one already washed hands 20, 30, 50 times prior.
actually going go back example little bit later talk
one particular category therapies effective many people OCD
cognitive behavioral exposure therapies. think
heard cognitive behavioral exposure therapies, way used treat
OCD much different way used treat sorts anxiety
disorders sorts disorders generally. fair say 70%
people OCD sort anxiety elevated anxiety, either directly related
OCD indirectly related OCD really hard tease apart
OCD can create anxiety, mentioned before, can even increase
anxiety. also issue depression. OCD can
depressing, especially OCD thoughts behaviors start really
impede people's ability function life. work, school, relationship, can
start feeling less optimistic life. fact, people can become suicidally
depressed. bad OCD can us. careful saying
70% people OCD also anxiety X number people OCD


also depressed don't know whether not depression led OCD
way around whether not operating, say science,
parallel. drug treatments OCD depression anxiety can tease
apart talk that, think fair say binds
obsessions compulsions anxiety, feeling of, say
urgent feeling need get rid obsession. person feels
way

00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity

can engage particular compulsive behavior. people
probably wondering genetic component OCD indeed is, although
nature isn't exactly clear. oftentimes people hear something
genetic component, think always directly inherited parent, not
always case. can genes surface siblings genes surface
children not readily apparent terms call phenotype.
genotype, gene, phenotype, way shows body
form like eye color shows terms behavior behavioral pattern.
Based twin studies researchers examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
even identical twins share sack utero, call monochorionic,
sitting little bag pregnancy different little bags, can see
different levels called genetic concordance. just sort cut
broad swath genetic data, fair say 40 50% OCD
cases genetic component, mutation inherited aspect
genetic one point got genome mapped. Now,
interesting, don't think terribly useful people. First all, can't really
control genes, least point history, even though things like
epigenetic control people excited technologies like CRISPR
modifying genome humans point, people can't control genetics,
right? can't pick parents say.

00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops

just know genetic component half people OCD, not


always. Now typical podcast, want focus neural
mechanisms chemical systems brain body generate obsessive-
compulsive disorder. fact, watched podcast before, listen podcast
before, always structure things. First, introduce topic explore
topic detail really define isn't.
important focus known not known biological
mechanisms generate whatever thing happens be, case, OCD
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Now want emphasize even
don't background biology, will make information accessible you.
also want emphasize interested treatments
anxiously awaiting description things can help OCD, encourage you,
will, please try digest material underlying mechanisms
understanding even just little bit biological mechanisms can really
help shed light particular drug behavioral treatments sorts
treatments work don't work. especially important case OCD
turns order type treatment can really vary according individual,
something really special important OCD really can't say
number sorts disorders described previous podcasts.
take step back look neural circuitry. going brain
body people OCD? intrusive recurrent thoughts? compulsions?
whole system bound anxiety? ways thinking that,
want keep mind brain two main functions. brain's main
functions take care housekeeping stuff, make sure digestion works,
make sure heart beats, make sure keep breathing no matter what, make sure
can see, can hear, can smell, et cetera, basic stuff,
enormous amount brain real estate designed allow predict
going happen next, either immediate future long-term future.
largely done based knowledge past. also memory
systems. course systems brain body designed
bind happening housekeeping level, like heart rate,
anticipation going happen next. thinking something
fearful, body will one type reaction. thinking something
pleasant relaxing, body will another type reaction. whenever hear
brain-body distinction, just remind everybody really no


distinction brain body think nervous system.
nervous system brain, eyes, spinal cord, course
connections organs body connections organs
body brain, spinal cord, et cetera. describe neural circuits,
don't want think just things happening head, certainly
happening head, fact, circuits described detail exist within
confines cranial vault, nerd speak skull, circuits driving
particular predictions therefore particular biases towards particular actions
body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate
information allowed pass conscious experience,
not. gating mechanism strongly regulated chemical GABA. GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, say, serves shut suppress
activity neurons. thalamic reticular nucleus really saying, no, touch
information cannot come right now. not thinking contact
back legs chair sitting on, Andrew, thinking
trying say hearing voice sounds
see front you, et cetera. Whereas get injection


doctor pain, pleasure, going think somatic sensation
level touch probably going think less smells room, although
might also think smells room seeing hearing.
can combine different sensory modalities, thalamic reticular nucleus
really allows us funnel, direct particular categories sensory experience
conscious awareness suppress categories sensory experience. addition,
thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass
conscious perception ones not, much
neuroscientists indeed neurophilosophers, want call that,
theorized philosophized thalamic reticular nucleus actually involved
consciousness. Now, consciousness isn't topic really want talk
episode kind mushy-murky, say science, shmooey term
doesn't really clear definitions arguments often get lost
fact people arguing different things. say consciousness,
mean conscious awareness. zoom take look circuit
got now know based neuroimaging studies intimately involved
generating obsessions compulsions OCD. cortex neocortex,
involved perception understanding happening. striatum
basal ganglia, involved generating behaviors, go, suppressing
behaviors, no-go. thalamus collects sensory
experience parallel, hearing, touch, smell, et cetera, not much smell
thalamus, mention, senses is. thalamus
encased thalamic reticular nucleus, serves kind guard saying
can pass can pass through, you, you, can't pass
conscious understanding perception. loop, cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop circuit thought underlie OCD, dysfunction
circuit thought underlie OCD. Now, again, circuit exists us
can operate healthy ways,

00:39:36 Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loop & OCD

can operate ways make us feel unhealthy even suffer full blown OCD.
know circuit involved OCD? Well there, can look
really interesting studies involve bringing human subjects laboratory


generating obsessions compulsions imaging brain using
variety techniques talked before. experiment look
like? Well, order sort experiment, first all, need people
OCD course need control subjects don't, need able
reliably evoke obsessions compulsions. Now, turns easily,
say simply done, 'cause can't easy people OCD,
straightforward, word looking for, straightforward
looking category obsessions compulsions relate order

obsession germs contamination compulsion hand wash,
give people, believe not, sweaty towel contains sweat odor

someone wipe sweat off back neck put towel

incredibly anxiety-provoking almost always evokes obsessions about, ugh,
really, really bad. really bad, need clean, need clean. need

good animal model studies, least point time, really
couldn't humans, although soon may change, now know causal way

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes

thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time

Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little

describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug

people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions

shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well
known associated stress system. Although every day, mention,
all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly
awakening. healthy increase cortisol. Late shift, mean, late day peaks


cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less
compete fashion production, derived molecule
cholesterol. certain biochemical pathways can either direct
cholesterol molecule toward cortisol synthesis testosterone synthesis, not both.
compete. cortisol goes general, not always, general,
testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship
cortisol testosterone, even tools try optimize
ratios males females, can find episode optimizing
testosterone estrogen, hubermanlab.com. Now, say
interesting aspect study not DHEA cortisol elevated females
OCD cortisol testosterone opposite effect, cortisol
testosterone males OCD, rather relationship those,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. terms GABA, GABA inhibitory
neurotransmitter tends quiet certain neuronal pathways, different things
different synapses, general, GABA present, inhibition

slightly elevated. situation pattern hormones
females males OCD different people without OCD
GABA transmission altered net effect overall reduction GABA.
Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may
seen before. certainly have, dramatic actually quite

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just
confess, first all, don't OCD, although will also confess

tick. six seven, recall trip Washington DC family,
feeling strong desire need even recall, grunt order clear
something throat, didn't anything throat. didn't cold
postnasal drip, really just feeling needed that, release sort
tension. remember dad time telling don't that. Don't that,
not good grunt something like that. think saw kind compulsive

hide room. Fortunately me, transient, think six months year
later, disappeared. Although notice, actually ex-girlfriend mine point

never diagnosed Tourette's. OCD? Maybe. certainly accused
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, talk still
minutes. point many children transiently express ticks low level
Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol
explored bunch different contexts, including ticks OCD, et cetera.
Going back inositol current use, say current use,
taking 900 milligrams inositol addition existing toolkit sleep,

taking 900 milligrams myo-inositol either alone combination sleep kit.
must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem
lead enhanced levels focus alertness day. perhaps
noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects
experiments actually stop taking inositol gastric discomfort gastric
distress called. reported results sleep kind anecdotal way.
certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating
supplement protocol. think great future nutraceuticals, meaning
think systematic exploration particular lower dosages context OCD
treatment. saw SSRIs prescription drug treatments,
think really needs exploration nutraceuticals combination
behavioral therapies.

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

incredibly high incidence OCD debilitating is. go really deep
debilitating. don't want spend much time think
pretty obvious, not. instance, one things
makes OCD debilitating is, course, shame talked before.
also fact people focusing obsessions compulsions,
not able focus things. simply way brain works.
not able focus many things once. thing OCD takes
lot time people's lives. recurrent intrusive thoughts happening high
frequency, even moderate frequency, people spending lot time thinking
stuff thinking behaviors need engage in,
engaging behaviors, mentioned before, just serve strengthen
compulsions not actually things make us
functional human beings like commuting work homework work
listening people talking interacting sports working out, things
make rich quality life taken OCD many cases.
might obvious some, not sure obvious everybody just much time
OCD can occupy. Another thing soon learn sadly,

00:15:10 Categories OCD

lot obsessions compulsions OCD often relate taboo topics.
general categories OCD fall three different bins, checking
obsessions compulsions, repetition obsessions compulsions, order
obsessions compulsions. checking ones somewhat obvious, checking
stove checking locks, think tend do. somebody typically
head off car commute work think, lock front door, go
back once, won't go back twice 50 times. People OCD will often go back 20
30 times actually allow drive off. real
challenge continue drive off discard idea didn't
check stove didn't check locks didn't check something else
critical. Repetition obsessions compulsions, obviously can dovetail
checking ones, tend things like counting off certain number
numbers, like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
People perform repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, feel to.

00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions

can imagine powerful debilitating loop really is. drill
little bit deeper obsessions compulsions relate one another.
draw line obsessions compulsions, line
described anxiety. Now, need define anxiety quite honest,
psychology science can't agree exactly anxiety is. Typically way
think fear heightened state autonomic arousal, increased
heart rate, increased breathing, sweating, et cetera, response immediate
present threat perceived threat. Whereas anxiety, generally speaking scientific
literature, relates sorts thought patterns somatic bodily responses,
heart rate, breathing, et cetera, without clear present danger
environment right there. way going talk anxiety now.
anxiety really binds obsessions compulsions someone will
intrusive thought. instance, someone will thought
turn left street, something bad will happen. Okay, obsession.
actually not uncommon. Now, bad specificity bad thing
really will vary. people will think, turn left, something generally bad will
happen, just makes feel anxious, always insist going right. Whereas
people will think turn left, will die, will die, something terrible
will happen, get disease someone else will get disease cursing
somebody else specific way. unfortunately quite common
people OCD. feeling feeling can generally
specifically related particular outcome. beneath feeling anxiety,
quickening heartbeat, quickening breathing, narrowing one's visual focus.
talked another podcast, Master Stress, another podcast
haven't heard those, let just briefly describe state
increased so-called autonomic arousal, alertness, stress, et cetera, visual field
literally narrows, aperture visual field gets smaller
relationship autonomic nervous system visual system, start
seeing world sort soda straw view binocular-like view,
opposed seeing big picture. important? Well, literally sharpens
narrows focus toward thing obsessions compulsions
focused on. person walking street sees opportunity go left


right will see bad decision, visual field narrows tightly along
possibility taking left turn. know describe seems totally irrational,
want emphasize person OCD knows irrational. might feel crazy
thoughts, know makes no sense whatsoever
left somehow different right terms outcomes particular
case, yet feels would. fact, cases feels went left,
full blown panic attack. idea obsessions
compulsions bound anxiety, taking right-hand turn, again,
one particular example, taking right-hand turn, brief, mention,
brief relief anxiety time decision go right, not left
additional drop anxiety one takes right-hand turn opposed left-
hand turn. alluded before, reinforcement compulsion.
words, going right, doesn't create situation brain psychology
person that, oh, know what, not anxious anymore, left would've probably
okay. reinforces idea right made feel better, turning right made
feel better, going left would've much worse. Again, reinforces
obsession even further. again, swap right turns left turns
something like hand washing, feeling something contaminated need
wash one's hands even though one already washed hands 20, 30, 50 times prior.
actually going go back example little bit later talk
one particular category therapies effective many people OCD

heard cognitive behavioral exposure therapies, way used treat
OCD much different way used treat sorts anxiety

impede people's ability function life. work, school, relationship, can
start feeling less optimistic life. fact, people can become suicidally

00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity

can engage particular compulsive behavior. people
probably wondering genetic component OCD indeed is, although
nature isn't exactly clear. oftentimes people hear something
genetic component, think always directly inherited parent, not
always case. can genes surface siblings genes surface
children not readily apparent terms call phenotype.
genotype, gene, phenotype, way shows body
form like eye color shows terms behavior behavioral pattern.
Based twin studies researchers examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
even identical twins share sack utero, call monochorionic,
sitting little bag pregnancy different little bags, can see
different levels called genetic concordance. just sort cut
broad swath genetic data, fair say 40 50% OCD
cases genetic component, mutation inherited aspect
genetic one point got genome mapped. Now,
interesting, don't think terribly useful people. First all, can't really
control genes, least point history, even though things like
epigenetic control people excited technologies like CRISPR
modifying genome humans point, people can't control genetics,
right? can't pick parents say.

00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops

just know genetic component half people OCD, not


always. Now typical podcast, want focus neural
mechanisms chemical systems brain body generate obsessive-
compulsive disorder. fact, watched podcast before, listen podcast
before, always structure things. First, introduce topic explore
topic detail really define isn't.
important focus known not known biological
mechanisms generate whatever thing happens be, case, OCD
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Now want emphasize even
don't background biology, will make information accessible you.
also want emphasize interested treatments
anxiously awaiting description things can help OCD, encourage you,
will, please try digest material underlying mechanisms
understanding even just little bit biological mechanisms can really
help shed light particular drug behavioral treatments sorts
treatments work don't work. especially important case OCD
turns order type treatment can really vary according individual,
something really special important OCD really can't say
number sorts disorders described previous podcasts.
take step back look neural circuitry. going brain
body people OCD? intrusive recurrent thoughts? compulsions?
whole system bound anxiety? ways thinking that,
want keep mind brain two main functions. brain's main
functions take care housekeeping stuff, make sure digestion works,
make sure heart beats, make sure keep breathing no matter what, make sure

happening head, fact, circuits described detail exist within
confines cranial vault, nerd speak skull, circuits driving
particular predictions therefore particular biases towards particular actions
body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate

thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass

things might not conscious qualify OCD. like
just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. SSRI? SSRI drug prevents re-uptake

12-week study done described before, two times week course 12

relieve OCD significant degree. know that? gave
Y-BOCS test talked before, Yale-Brown test questions
read few. OCD severity one Y-BOCS
measured terms index goes 8 way 28,
shouldn't mean anything. number eight kind meaningless here. terms
index meaningful Y-BOCS, somebody threshold 16

dramatic effect reducing obsessions compulsions four
weeks, score that, case, ranged 8 28, dropped way 25
11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least
study, tell study is, Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005
American Journal Psychiatry, also provide link can peruse
data like. least study, cognitive behavioral therapy
effective, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, less effective. happens
combine them? Well, explored well, combination cognitive
behavioral therapy SSRIs together not lead decrease OCD
symptoms. points idea cognitive behavioral therapy effective
treatment. again, say cognitive behavioral therapy, now still referring
cognitive behavioral, slash, exposure therapy done way detailed before,
twice week 12 weeks more. data, least study, point
fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.
alleviate OCD symptoms everybody? No. time consuming? Yes. Twice
week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual

fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also

weeks,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive

reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation

National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,

wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

remember years ago watching documentary band, Ramones, right?
people heard Ramones, right? Jeans, T-shirts, aviator glasses, everyone
change last name Ramone. weren't actually related one
another, way. change last name Ramone. Ramones
one band member admittedly known others OCD.
documentary, forget name, think called, can't remember,
anyway, can't remember, hippocampal lapse there, documentary, band
members describe Joey Ramone leaving hotels, walking stairs
parking lot, walk seven eight times,
sometimes getting van walking seven eight
times always certain number times, given certain number stairs.
appears, quote-unquote, crazy, course, don't want think
crazy. somebody likely full blown OCD. Now particular
example, believe not, not uncommon. just happens example
entailed certain compulsions behaviors overt people
see. can imagine prevent somebody moving
daily life easily. lot people, mentioned before, obsessions
compulsions hide little micro behaviors, just count
off head opposed generating sort walking downstairs
tapping things sort. checking, repetition,
order. Order oftentimes thought putting cleanliness making sure everything
aligned perfect orderly. oftentimes case,
forms order people OCD can focus obsessive compulsive way.
Things like incompleteness, idea one can't walk away something stop
something something's not right complete picture.
way table set. way something's written page.
email. Again, now still talking OCD, disorder. not talking
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. aware of, well, just direct,
several colleagues mine just remarkable, order emails. Every email
perfect, punctuated, perfect, grammar, perfect, everything's spaced perfect.
OCD? Well, might, might not. know unless disclose
me. might obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, just might
able generate lot order lot discipline around way
write, way present communication anybody all. somebody


OCD domain order, incompleteness constant
feeling something not completed need complete it. can also
terms symmetry, everything aligned symmetric way.
seen perhaps young kids. one example read literature children
need arrange stuffed animals exact order every day
particular order point move little stuffed frog next
stuffed rabbit, child anxiety reaction feel literally
compelled, driven fix maybe even multiple times again. talk
OCD children versus adults little bit. aspect order,
little bit less intuitive, notion disgust, idea something
contaminated. often think OCD hand washing behavior response
people feeling something contaminated, space, towel, et cetera, even
simply somebody else's hand unwilling shake somebody's hand.
can imagine different bins obsessions compulsions, checking
repetition order extremely debilitating depending severe
many different domains life show in. oftentimes movies
even way describing now sounds if, okay, well somebody check
locks don't also check stove, somebody need count
seven back forth seven seven seven times seven times day
something sort need symmetry specific domains life.
turns recurrent intrusive aspect obsessions leads people OCD
checking repetition and/or order compulsions everywhere. whether not
somebody work school trying engage sport trying engage
relationship just something simple like walking street, obsessions
intrusive show compel people things domain
independent whether not happen one location another.
words, thought patterns behaviors take environment opposed
environment driving thought patterns behaviors. therefore becomes
impossible ever find room clean enough, find bed made well
enough, find anything done well enough remove obsession. know
said multiple times now, going say many times throughout episode
somewhat obsessive, believe justified way every time one engages
compulsion related obsession, obsession simply becomes stronger.



00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions

can imagine powerful debilitating loop really is. drill
little bit deeper obsessions compulsions relate one another.
draw line obsessions compulsions, line
described anxiety. Now, need define anxiety quite honest,
psychology science can't agree exactly anxiety is. Typically way
think fear heightened state autonomic arousal, increased
heart rate, increased breathing, sweating, et cetera, response immediate
present threat perceived threat. Whereas anxiety, generally speaking scientific
literature, relates sorts thought patterns somatic bodily responses,
heart rate, breathing, et cetera, without clear present danger
environment right there. way going talk anxiety now.
anxiety really binds obsessions compulsions someone will
intrusive thought. instance, someone will thought
turn left street, something bad will happen. Okay, obsession.
actually not uncommon. Now, bad specificity bad thing
really will vary. people will think, turn left, something generally bad will
happen, just makes feel anxious, always insist going right. Whereas
people will think turn left, will die, will die, something terrible
will happen, get disease someone else will get disease cursing
somebody else specific way. unfortunately quite common
people OCD. feeling feeling can generally
specifically related particular outcome. beneath feeling anxiety,
quickening heartbeat, quickening breathing, narrowing one's visual focus.
talked another podcast, Master Stress, another podcast
haven't heard those, let just briefly describe state
increased so-called autonomic arousal, alertness, stress, et cetera, visual field
literally narrows, aperture visual field gets smaller
relationship autonomic nervous system visual system, start
seeing world sort soda straw view binocular-like view,
opposed seeing big picture. important? Well, literally sharpens
narrows focus toward thing obsessions compulsions
focused on. person walking street sees opportunity go left


right will see bad decision, visual field narrows tightly along
possibility taking left turn. know describe seems totally irrational,
want emphasize person OCD knows irrational. might feel crazy
thoughts, know makes no sense whatsoever
left somehow different right terms outcomes particular
case, yet feels would. fact, cases feels went left,
full blown panic attack. idea obsessions
compulsions bound anxiety, taking right-hand turn, again,
one particular example, taking right-hand turn, brief, mention,
brief relief anxiety time decision go right, not left
additional drop anxiety one takes right-hand turn opposed left-
hand turn. alluded before, reinforcement compulsion.
words, going right, doesn't create situation brain psychology
person that, oh, know what, not anxious anymore, left would've probably
okay. reinforces idea right made feel better, turning right made
feel better, going left would've much worse. Again, reinforces
obsession even further. again, swap right turns left turns
something like hand washing, feeling something contaminated need
wash one's hands even though one already washed hands 20, 30, 50 times prior.
actually going go back example little bit later talk
one particular category therapies effective many people OCD
cognitive behavioral exposure therapies. think
heard cognitive behavioral exposure therapies, way used treat
OCD much different way used treat sorts anxiety
disorders sorts disorders generally. fair say 70%
people OCD sort anxiety elevated anxiety, either directly related
OCD indirectly related OCD really hard tease apart
OCD can create anxiety, mentioned before, can even increase
anxiety. also issue depression. OCD can
depressing, especially OCD thoughts behaviors start really
impede people's ability function life. work, school, relationship, can
start feeling less optimistic life. fact, people can become suicidally
depressed. bad OCD can us. careful saying
70% people OCD also anxiety X number people OCD


also depressed don't know whether not depression led OCD
way around whether not operating, say science,
parallel. drug treatments OCD depression anxiety can tease
apart talk that, think fair say binds
obsessions compulsions anxiety, feeling of, say
urgent feeling need get rid obsession. person feels
way

00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity

can engage particular compulsive behavior. people
probably wondering genetic component OCD indeed is, although
nature isn't exactly clear. oftentimes people hear something
genetic component, think always directly inherited parent, not
always case. can genes surface siblings genes surface
children not readily apparent terms call phenotype.
genotype, gene, phenotype, way shows body
form like eye color shows terms behavior behavioral pattern.
Based twin studies researchers examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
even identical twins share sack utero, call monochorionic,
sitting little bag pregnancy different little bags, can see
different levels called genetic concordance. just sort cut
broad swath genetic data, fair say 40 50% OCD
cases genetic component, mutation inherited aspect
genetic one point got genome mapped. Now,
interesting, don't think terribly useful people. First all, can't really
control genes, least point history, even though things like
epigenetic control people excited technologies like CRISPR
modifying genome humans point, people can't control genetics,
right? can't pick parents say.

00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops

just know genetic component half people OCD, not


always. Now typical podcast, want focus neural
mechanisms chemical systems brain body generate obsessive-
compulsive disorder. fact, watched podcast before, listen podcast
before, always structure things. First, introduce topic explore
topic detail really define isn't.
important focus known not known biological
mechanisms generate whatever thing happens be, case, OCD
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Now want emphasize even
don't background biology, will make information accessible you.
also want emphasize interested treatments
anxiously awaiting description things can help OCD, encourage you,
will, please try digest material underlying mechanisms
understanding even just little bit biological mechanisms can really
help shed light particular drug behavioral treatments sorts
treatments work don't work. especially important case OCD
turns order type treatment can really vary according individual,
something really special important OCD really can't say
number sorts disorders described previous podcasts.
take step back look neural circuitry. going brain
body people OCD? intrusive recurrent thoughts? compulsions?
whole system bound anxiety? ways thinking that,
want keep mind brain two main functions. brain's main
functions take care housekeeping stuff, make sure digestion works,
make sure heart beats, make sure keep breathing no matter what, make sure
can see, can hear, can smell, et cetera, basic stuff,
enormous amount brain real estate designed allow predict
going happen next, either immediate future long-term future.
largely done based knowledge past. also memory
systems. course systems brain body designed
bind happening housekeeping level, like heart rate,
anticipation going happen next. thinking something
fearful, body will one type reaction. thinking something
pleasant relaxing, body will another type reaction. whenever hear
brain-body distinction, just remind everybody really no


distinction brain body think nervous system.
nervous system brain, eyes, spinal cord, course
connections organs body connections organs
body brain, spinal cord, et cetera. describe neural circuits,
don't want think just things happening head, certainly
happening head, fact, circuits described detail exist within
confines cranial vault, nerd speak skull, circuits driving
particular predictions therefore particular biases towards particular actions
body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate
information allowed pass conscious experience,
not. gating mechanism strongly regulated chemical GABA. GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, say, serves shut suppress
activity neurons. thalamic reticular nucleus really saying, no, touch
information cannot come right now. not thinking contact
back legs chair sitting on, Andrew, thinking
trying say hearing voice sounds
see front you, et cetera. Whereas get injection


doctor pain, pleasure, going think somatic sensation
level touch probably going think less smells room, although
might also think smells room seeing hearing.
can combine different sensory modalities, thalamic reticular nucleus
really allows us funnel, direct particular categories sensory experience
conscious awareness suppress categories sensory experience. addition,
thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass
conscious perception ones not, much
neuroscientists indeed neurophilosophers, want call that,
theorized philosophized thalamic reticular nucleus actually involved
consciousness. Now, consciousness isn't topic really want talk
episode kind mushy-murky, say science, shmooey term
doesn't really clear definitions arguments often get lost
fact people arguing different things. say consciousness,
mean conscious awareness. zoom take look circuit
got now know based neuroimaging studies intimately involved
generating obsessions compulsions OCD. cortex neocortex,
involved perception understanding happening. striatum
basal ganglia, involved generating behaviors, go, suppressing
behaviors, no-go. thalamus collects sensory
experience parallel, hearing, touch, smell, et cetera, not much smell
thalamus, mention, senses is. thalamus
encased thalamic reticular nucleus, serves kind guard saying
can pass can pass through, you, you, can't pass
conscious understanding perception. loop, cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop circuit thought underlie OCD, dysfunction

incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,

three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively

states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions

ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols

excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments

Now different results described laboratory

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work

can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,
explored. study Dr. Blair Simpson looked this.
fairly small scale study. first all, give title. again, provide link.

remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety

ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger

think jumping off. fact nervous system,

nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor

helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards

actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things

depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural

OCD domain order, incompleteness constant
feeling something not completed need complete it. can also
terms symmetry, everything aligned symmetric way.
seen perhaps young kids. one example read literature children
need arrange stuffed animals exact order every day
particular order point move little stuffed frog next
stuffed rabbit, child anxiety reaction feel literally
compelled, driven fix maybe even multiple times again. talk
OCD children versus adults little bit. aspect order,
little bit less intuitive, notion disgust, idea something
contaminated. often think OCD hand washing behavior response
people feeling something contaminated, space, towel, et cetera, even
simply somebody else's hand unwilling shake somebody's hand.
can imagine different bins obsessions compulsions, checking
repetition order extremely debilitating depending severe
many different domains life show in. oftentimes movies
even way describing now sounds if, okay, well somebody check
locks don't also check stove, somebody need count
seven back forth seven seven seven times seven times day
something sort need symmetry specific domains life.
turns recurrent intrusive aspect obsessions leads people OCD
checking repetition and/or order compulsions everywhere. whether not
somebody work school trying engage sport trying engage
relationship just something simple like walking street, obsessions
intrusive show compel people things domain
independent whether not happen one location another.
words, thought patterns behaviors take environment opposed
environment driving thought patterns behaviors. therefore becomes
impossible ever find room clean enough, find bed made well
enough, find anything done well enough remove obsession. know
said multiple times now, going say many times throughout episode
somewhat obsessive, believe justified way every time one engages
compulsion related obsession, obsession simply becomes stronger.



00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions

can imagine powerful debilitating loop really is. drill
little bit deeper obsessions compulsions relate one another.
draw line obsessions compulsions, line
described anxiety. Now, need define anxiety quite honest,
psychology science can't agree exactly anxiety is. Typically way
think fear heightened state autonomic arousal, increased
heart rate, increased breathing, sweating, et cetera, response immediate
present threat perceived threat. Whereas anxiety, generally speaking scientific
literature, relates sorts thought patterns somatic bodily responses,
heart rate, breathing, et cetera, without clear present danger
environment right there. way going talk anxiety now.
anxiety really binds obsessions compulsions someone will
intrusive thought. instance, someone will thought
turn left street, something bad will happen. Okay, obsession.
actually not uncommon. Now, bad specificity bad thing
really will vary. people will think, turn left, something generally bad will
happen, just makes feel anxious, always insist going right. Whereas
people will think turn left, will die, will die, something terrible
will happen, get disease someone else will get disease cursing
somebody else specific way. unfortunately quite common
people OCD. feeling feeling can generally
specifically related particular outcome. beneath feeling anxiety,
quickening heartbeat, quickening breathing, narrowing one's visual focus.
talked another podcast, Master Stress, another podcast
haven't heard those, let just briefly describe state
increased so-called autonomic arousal, alertness, stress, et cetera, visual field
literally narrows, aperture visual field gets smaller
relationship autonomic nervous system visual system, start
seeing world sort soda straw view binocular-like view,
opposed seeing big picture. important? Well, literally sharpens
narrows focus toward thing obsessions compulsions
focused on. person walking street sees opportunity go left


right will see bad decision, visual field narrows tightly along
possibility taking left turn. know describe seems totally irrational,
want emphasize person OCD knows irrational. might feel crazy
thoughts, know makes no sense whatsoever
left somehow different right terms outcomes particular
case, yet feels would. fact, cases feels went left,
full blown panic attack. idea obsessions
compulsions bound anxiety, taking right-hand turn, again,
one particular example, taking right-hand turn, brief, mention,
brief relief anxiety time decision go right, not left
additional drop anxiety one takes right-hand turn opposed left-
hand turn. alluded before, reinforcement compulsion.
words, going right, doesn't create situation brain psychology
person that, oh, know what, not anxious anymore, left would've probably
okay. reinforces idea right made feel better, turning right made
feel better, going left would've much worse. Again, reinforces
obsession even further. again, swap right turns left turns
something like hand washing, feeling something contaminated need
wash one's hands even though one already washed hands 20, 30, 50 times prior.
actually going go back example little bit later talk
one particular category therapies effective many people OCD
cognitive behavioral exposure therapies. think
heard cognitive behavioral exposure therapies, way used treat
OCD much different way used treat sorts anxiety
disorders sorts disorders generally. fair say 70%
people OCD sort anxiety elevated anxiety, either directly related
OCD indirectly related OCD really hard tease apart
OCD can create anxiety, mentioned before, can even increase
anxiety. also issue depression. OCD can
depressing, especially OCD thoughts behaviors start really
impede people's ability function life. work, school, relationship, can
start feeling less optimistic life. fact, people can become suicidally
depressed. bad OCD can us. careful saying
70% people OCD also anxiety X number people OCD


also depressed don't know whether not depression led OCD
way around whether not operating, say science,
parallel. drug treatments OCD depression anxiety can tease
apart talk that, think fair say binds
obsessions compulsions anxiety, feeling of, say
urgent feeling need get rid obsession. person feels
way

00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity

can engage particular compulsive behavior. people
probably wondering genetic component OCD indeed is, although
nature isn't exactly clear. oftentimes people hear something
genetic component, think always directly inherited parent, not
always case. can genes surface siblings genes surface
children not readily apparent terms call phenotype.
genotype, gene, phenotype, way shows body
form like eye color shows terms behavior behavioral pattern.
Based twin studies researchers examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
even identical twins share sack utero, call monochorionic,
sitting little bag pregnancy different little bags, can see
different levels called genetic concordance. just sort cut
broad swath genetic data, fair say 40 50% OCD
cases genetic component, mutation inherited aspect
genetic one point got genome mapped. Now,
interesting, don't think terribly useful people. First all, can't really
control genes, least point history, even though things like
epigenetic control people excited technologies like CRISPR
modifying genome humans point, people can't control genetics,
right? can't pick parents say.

00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops

just know genetic component half people OCD, not


always. Now typical podcast, want focus neural
mechanisms chemical systems brain body generate obsessive-
compulsive disorder. fact, watched podcast before, listen podcast
before, always structure things. First, introduce topic explore
topic detail really define isn't.
important focus known not known biological
mechanisms generate whatever thing happens be, case, OCD
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Now want emphasize even
don't background biology, will make information accessible you.
also want emphasize interested treatments
anxiously awaiting description things can help OCD, encourage you,
will, please try digest material underlying mechanisms
understanding even just little bit biological mechanisms can really
help shed light particular drug behavioral treatments sorts
treatments work don't work. especially important case OCD
turns order type treatment can really vary according individual,
something really special important OCD really can't say
number sorts disorders described previous podcasts.
take step back look neural circuitry. going brain
body people OCD? intrusive recurrent thoughts? compulsions?
whole system bound anxiety? ways thinking that,
want keep mind brain two main functions. brain's main
functions take care housekeeping stuff, make sure digestion works,
make sure heart beats, make sure keep breathing no matter what, make sure
can see, can hear, can smell, et cetera, basic stuff,
enormous amount brain real estate designed allow predict
going happen next, either immediate future long-term future.
largely done based knowledge past. also memory
systems. course systems brain body designed
bind happening housekeeping level, like heart rate,
anticipation going happen next. thinking something
fearful, body will one type reaction. thinking something
pleasant relaxing, body will another type reaction. whenever hear
brain-body distinction, just remind everybody really no


distinction brain body think nervous system.
nervous system brain, eyes, spinal cord, course
connections organs body connections organs
body brain, spinal cord, et cetera. describe neural circuits,
don't want think just things happening head, certainly
happening head, fact, circuits described detail exist within
confines cranial vault, nerd speak skull, circuits driving
particular predictions therefore particular biases towards particular actions
body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate
information allowed pass conscious experience,
not. gating mechanism strongly regulated chemical GABA. GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, say, serves shut suppress
activity neurons. thalamic reticular nucleus really saying, no, touch
information cannot come right now. not thinking contact
back legs chair sitting on, Andrew, thinking
trying say hearing voice sounds
see front you, et cetera. Whereas get injection


doctor pain, pleasure, going think somatic sensation
level touch probably going think less smells room, although
might also think smells room seeing hearing.
can combine different sensory modalities, thalamic reticular nucleus
really allows us funnel, direct particular categories sensory experience
conscious awareness suppress categories sensory experience. addition,
thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass
conscious perception ones not, much
neuroscientists indeed neurophilosophers, want call that,
theorized philosophized thalamic reticular nucleus actually involved
consciousness. Now, consciousness isn't topic really want talk
episode kind mushy-murky, say science, shmooey term
doesn't really clear definitions arguments often get lost
fact people arguing different things. say consciousness,
mean conscious awareness. zoom take look circuit
got now know based neuroimaging studies intimately involved
generating obsessions compulsions OCD. cortex neocortex,
involved perception understanding happening. striatum
basal ganglia, involved generating behaviors, go, suppressing
behaviors, no-go. thalamus collects sensory
experience parallel, hearing, touch, smell, et cetera, not much smell
thalamus, mention, senses is. thalamus
encased thalamic reticular nucleus, serves kind guard saying
can pass can pass through, you, you, can't pass
conscious understanding perception. loop, cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop circuit thought underlie OCD, dysfunction
circuit thought underlie OCD. Now, again, circuit exists us
can operate healthy ways,

00:39:36 Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loop & OCD

know circuit involved OCD? Well there, can look

called Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. is, scientists love

typically someone will go clinic either family member encouraged

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least

homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

serotonin depleted humans low levels serotonin,
can see evidence cognitive inflexibility, challenges tasks, switching challenges

OCD. Again, one starts explore different transmitter systems
explored animal models humans, vast, vast landscape,
serotonergic drugs seem effective drugs treating OCD despite
fact, again, despite fact no direct evidence serotonin systems
problem OCD. recall cortico-striatal-thalamic loop central

clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also
show reductions cortico-striatal-thalamic loops. basically situation
behavioral therapy works, many people, not all,
pretty good understanding works. increases anxiety tolerance,

week, cognitive behavioral sessions, taking SSRI 10 12
weeks,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't

treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just

Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol

Going back inositol current use, say current use,

must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem

noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,

consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,

certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions

can imagine powerful debilitating loop really is. drill
little bit deeper obsessions compulsions relate one another.
draw line obsessions compulsions, line
described anxiety. Now, need define anxiety quite honest,
psychology science can't agree exactly anxiety is. Typically way
think fear heightened state autonomic arousal, increased
heart rate, increased breathing, sweating, et cetera, response immediate
present threat perceived threat. Whereas anxiety, generally speaking scientific
literature, relates sorts thought patterns somatic bodily responses,
heart rate, breathing, et cetera, without clear present danger
environment right there. way going talk anxiety now.
anxiety really binds obsessions compulsions someone will
intrusive thought. instance, someone will thought
turn left street, something bad will happen. Okay, obsession.
actually not uncommon. Now, bad specificity bad thing
really will vary. people will think, turn left, something generally bad will
happen, just makes feel anxious, always insist going right. Whereas
people will think turn left, will die, will die, something terrible
will happen, get disease someone else will get disease cursing
somebody else specific way. unfortunately quite common
people OCD. feeling feeling can generally
specifically related particular outcome. beneath feeling anxiety,
quickening heartbeat, quickening breathing, narrowing one's visual focus.
talked another podcast, Master Stress, another podcast
haven't heard those, let just briefly describe state
increased so-called autonomic arousal, alertness, stress, et cetera, visual field
literally narrows, aperture visual field gets smaller
relationship autonomic nervous system visual system, start
seeing world sort soda straw view binocular-like view,
opposed seeing big picture. important? Well, literally sharpens
narrows focus toward thing obsessions compulsions
focused on. person walking street sees opportunity go left


right will see bad decision, visual field narrows tightly along
possibility taking left turn. know describe seems totally irrational,
want emphasize person OCD knows irrational. might feel crazy
thoughts, know makes no sense whatsoever
left somehow different right terms outcomes particular
case, yet feels would. fact, cases feels went left,
full blown panic attack. idea obsessions
compulsions bound anxiety, taking right-hand turn, again,
one particular example, taking right-hand turn, brief, mention,
brief relief anxiety time decision go right, not left
additional drop anxiety one takes right-hand turn opposed left-
hand turn. alluded before, reinforcement compulsion.
words, going right, doesn't create situation brain psychology
person that, oh, know what, not anxious anymore, left would've probably
okay. reinforces idea right made feel better, turning right made
feel better, going left would've much worse. Again, reinforces
obsession even further. again, swap right turns left turns
something like hand washing, feeling something contaminated need
wash one's hands even though one already washed hands 20, 30, 50 times prior.
actually going go back example little bit later talk
one particular category therapies effective many people OCD
cognitive behavioral exposure therapies. think
heard cognitive behavioral exposure therapies, way used treat
OCD much different way used treat sorts anxiety
disorders sorts disorders generally. fair say 70%
people OCD sort anxiety elevated anxiety, either directly related
OCD indirectly related OCD really hard tease apart
OCD can create anxiety, mentioned before, can even increase
anxiety. also issue depression. OCD can
depressing, especially OCD thoughts behaviors start really
impede people's ability function life. work, school, relationship, can
start feeling less optimistic life. fact, people can become suicidally
depressed. bad OCD can us. careful saying
70% people OCD also anxiety X number people OCD


also depressed don't know whether not depression led OCD
way around whether not operating, say science,
parallel. drug treatments OCD depression anxiety can tease
apart talk that, think fair say binds
obsessions compulsions anxiety, feeling of, say
urgent feeling need get rid obsession. person feels
way

00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity

can engage particular compulsive behavior. people
probably wondering genetic component OCD indeed is, although
nature isn't exactly clear. oftentimes people hear something
genetic component, think always directly inherited parent, not
always case. can genes surface siblings genes surface
children not readily apparent terms call phenotype.
genotype, gene, phenotype, way shows body
form like eye color shows terms behavior behavioral pattern.
Based twin studies researchers examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
even identical twins share sack utero, call monochorionic,
sitting little bag pregnancy different little bags, can see
different levels called genetic concordance. just sort cut
broad swath genetic data, fair say 40 50% OCD
cases genetic component, mutation inherited aspect
genetic one point got genome mapped. Now,
interesting, don't think terribly useful people. First all, can't really
control genes, least point history, even though things like
epigenetic control people excited technologies like CRISPR
modifying genome humans point, people can't control genetics,
right? can't pick parents say.

00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops

just know genetic component half people OCD, not


always. Now typical podcast, want focus neural
mechanisms chemical systems brain body generate obsessive-
compulsive disorder. fact, watched podcast before, listen podcast
before, always structure things. First, introduce topic explore
topic detail really define isn't.
important focus known not known biological
mechanisms generate whatever thing happens be, case, OCD
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Now want emphasize even
don't background biology, will make information accessible you.
also want emphasize interested treatments
anxiously awaiting description things can help OCD, encourage you,
will, please try digest material underlying mechanisms
understanding even just little bit biological mechanisms can really
help shed light particular drug behavioral treatments sorts
treatments work don't work. especially important case OCD
turns order type treatment can really vary according individual,
something really special important OCD really can't say
number sorts disorders described previous podcasts.
take step back look neural circuitry. going brain
body people OCD? intrusive recurrent thoughts? compulsions?
whole system bound anxiety? ways thinking that,
want keep mind brain two main functions. brain's main
functions take care housekeeping stuff, make sure digestion works,
make sure heart beats, make sure keep breathing no matter what, make sure
can see, can hear, can smell, et cetera, basic stuff,
enormous amount brain real estate designed allow predict
going happen next, either immediate future long-term future.
largely done based knowledge past. also memory
systems. course systems brain body designed
bind happening housekeeping level, like heart rate,
anticipation going happen next. thinking something
fearful, body will one type reaction. thinking something
pleasant relaxing, body will another type reaction. whenever hear
brain-body distinction, just remind everybody really no


distinction brain body think nervous system.
nervous system brain, eyes, spinal cord, course
connections organs body connections organs
body brain, spinal cord, et cetera. describe neural circuits,
don't want think just things happening head, certainly
happening head, fact, circuits described detail exist within
confines cranial vault, nerd speak skull, circuits driving
particular predictions therefore particular biases towards particular actions
body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate
information allowed pass conscious experience,
not. gating mechanism strongly regulated chemical GABA. GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, say, serves shut suppress
activity neurons. thalamic reticular nucleus really saying, no, touch
information cannot come right now. not thinking contact
back legs chair sitting on, Andrew, thinking
trying say hearing voice sounds
see front you, et cetera. Whereas get injection


doctor pain, pleasure, going think somatic sensation
level touch probably going think less smells room, although
might also think smells room seeing hearing.
can combine different sensory modalities, thalamic reticular nucleus
really allows us funnel, direct particular categories sensory experience
conscious awareness suppress categories sensory experience. addition,
thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass
conscious perception ones not, much
neuroscientists indeed neurophilosophers, want call that,
theorized philosophized thalamic reticular nucleus actually involved
consciousness. Now, consciousness isn't topic really want talk
episode kind mushy-murky, say science, shmooey term
doesn't really clear definitions arguments often get lost
fact people arguing different things. say consciousness,
mean conscious awareness. zoom take look circuit
got now know based neuroimaging studies intimately involved
generating obsessions compulsions OCD. cortex neocortex,
involved perception understanding happening. striatum
basal ganglia, involved generating behaviors, go, suppressing
behaviors, no-go. thalamus collects sensory
experience parallel, hearing, touch, smell, et cetera, not much smell
thalamus, mention, senses is. thalamus
encased thalamic reticular nucleus, serves kind guard saying
can pass can pass through, you, you, can't pass
conscious understanding perception. loop, cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop circuit thought underlie OCD, dysfunction
circuit thought underlie OCD. Now, again, circuit exists us
can operate healthy ways,

00:39:36 Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loop & OCD

can operate ways make us feel unhealthy even suffer full blown OCD.
know circuit involved OCD? Well there, can look
really interesting studies involve bringing human subjects laboratory


generating obsessions compulsions imaging brain using
variety techniques talked before. experiment look
like? Well, order sort experiment, first all, need people
OCD course need control subjects don't, need able
reliably evoke obsessions compulsions. Now, turns easily,
say simply done, 'cause can't easy people OCD,
straightforward, word looking for, straightforward
looking category obsessions compulsions relate order
cleanliness. typically bring subjects laboratory
obsession germs contamination compulsion hand wash,
give people, believe not, sweaty towel contains sweat odor
liquid, basically, somebody else's hands. fact, sometimes
someone wipe sweat off back neck put towel
put front person, can imagine someone OCD
incredibly anxiety-provoking almost always evokes obsessions about, ugh,
really, really bad. really bad, need clean, need clean. need
clean. Now someone brain scanner
imaged positron emission tomography. can also look
patterns activation brain person hand washing. Although
sometimes apparati associated imaging studies make hard lot
movement, can sorts studies. done sorts studies
many subjects using different variations just described. low behold

Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new

level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols

papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long

people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try

excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean

also quite impressively explored happens people already taking

often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral

Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,

say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,
explored. study Dr. Blair Simpson looked this.
fairly small scale study. first all, give title. again, provide link.
entitled, Acute effects cannabinoids symptoms obsessive-compulsive
disorder: human laboratory study. briefly, 14 adults OCD.

others 7% THC, groups is, 0.4% CBD THC.
looked CBD. know lot people interested CBD. one
studies find explored different percentages THC CBD
cannabis marijuana cigarettes basically. total amount consumed,
believe, 800 milligrams. These, again, not suggestions. just simply
reporting study. can, again, provide link. looked OCD
symptoms, ratings. looked cardiovascular effects. large number
different things explored. say study done 2020,
first placebo-controlled investigation cannabis adults obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Pretty interesting. just reading conclusions here.
data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety
compared placebo. not see a, say positive effect, mean
ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure
also going people YouTube comments section saying
cannabis CBD helps OCD symptoms, least anticipate probably will.
Almost everything say here, somebody will contradict something
experience, encourage, way. want hear experience
certain things even not randomized placebo-controlled studies, still find
interesting know people experiencing. think
one better uses social media comment sections, able share
that, not advice-giving way prescriptive way,

01:39:29 Ketamine Treatment

really important point, not just sake discussion obsessive-compulsive

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well

all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly

cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less

testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated

broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people

00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity

can engage particular compulsive behavior. people
probably wondering genetic component OCD indeed is, although
nature isn't exactly clear. oftentimes people hear something
genetic component, think always directly inherited parent, not
always case. can genes surface siblings genes surface
children not readily apparent terms call phenotype.
genotype, gene, phenotype, way shows body
form like eye color shows terms behavior behavioral pattern.
Based twin studies researchers examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
even identical twins share sack utero, call monochorionic,
sitting little bag pregnancy different little bags, can see
different levels called genetic concordance. just sort cut
broad swath genetic data, fair say 40 50% OCD
cases genetic component, mutation inherited aspect
genetic one point got genome mapped. Now,
interesting, don't think terribly useful people. First all, can't really
control genes, least point history, even though things like
epigenetic control people excited technologies like CRISPR
modifying genome humans point, people can't control genetics,
right? can't pick parents say.

00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops

just know genetic component half people OCD, not


always. Now typical podcast, want focus neural
mechanisms chemical systems brain body generate obsessive-
compulsive disorder. fact, watched podcast before, listen podcast
before, always structure things. First, introduce topic explore
topic detail really define isn't.
important focus known not known biological
mechanisms generate whatever thing happens be, case, OCD
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Now want emphasize even
don't background biology, will make information accessible you.
also want emphasize interested treatments
anxiously awaiting description things can help OCD, encourage you,
will, please try digest material underlying mechanisms
understanding even just little bit biological mechanisms can really
help shed light particular drug behavioral treatments sorts
treatments work don't work. especially important case OCD
turns order type treatment can really vary according individual,
something really special important OCD really can't say
number sorts disorders described previous podcasts.
take step back look neural circuitry. going brain
body people OCD? intrusive recurrent thoughts? compulsions?
whole system bound anxiety? ways thinking that,
want keep mind brain two main functions. brain's main
functions take care housekeeping stuff, make sure digestion works,
make sure heart beats, make sure keep breathing no matter what, make sure
can see, can hear, can smell, et cetera, basic stuff,
enormous amount brain real estate designed allow predict
going happen next, either immediate future long-term future.
largely done based knowledge past. also memory
systems. course systems brain body designed
bind happening housekeeping level, like heart rate,
anticipation going happen next. thinking something
fearful, body will one type reaction. thinking something
pleasant relaxing, body will another type reaction. whenever hear
brain-body distinction, just remind everybody really no


distinction brain body think nervous system.
nervous system brain, eyes, spinal cord, course
connections organs body connections organs
body brain, spinal cord, et cetera. describe neural circuits,
don't want think just things happening head, certainly
happening head, fact, circuits described detail exist within
confines cranial vault, nerd speak skull, circuits driving
particular predictions therefore particular biases towards particular actions
body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate
information allowed pass conscious experience,
not. gating mechanism strongly regulated chemical GABA. GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, say, serves shut suppress

thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass

incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation

obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,

thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second

describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.

think safe say drugs use dosage whether not

fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger

way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive

great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young

interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people

00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity

can engage particular compulsive behavior. people
probably wondering genetic component OCD indeed is, although
nature isn't exactly clear. oftentimes people hear something
genetic component, think always directly inherited parent, not
always case. can genes surface siblings genes surface
children not readily apparent terms call phenotype.
genotype, gene, phenotype, way shows body
form like eye color shows terms behavior behavioral pattern.
Based twin studies researchers examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
even identical twins share sack utero, call monochorionic,
sitting little bag pregnancy different little bags, can see
different levels called genetic concordance. just sort cut
broad swath genetic data, fair say 40 50% OCD
cases genetic component, mutation inherited aspect
genetic one point got genome mapped. Now,
interesting, don't think terribly useful people. First all, can't really
control genes, least point history, even though things like
epigenetic control people excited technologies like CRISPR
modifying genome humans point, people can't control genetics,
right? can't pick parents say.

00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops

just know genetic component half people OCD, not

also want emphasize interested treatments
anxiously awaiting description things can help OCD, encourage you,

understanding even just little bit biological mechanisms can really
help shed light particular drug behavioral treatments sorts

something really special important OCD really can't say

take step back look neural circuitry. going brain
body people OCD? intrusive recurrent thoughts? compulsions?
whole system bound anxiety? ways thinking that,
want keep mind brain two main functions. brain's main

make sure heart beats, make sure keep breathing no matter what, make sure

enormous amount brain real estate designed allow predict

bind happening housekeeping level, like heart rate,
anticipation going happen next. thinking something

pleasant relaxing, body will another type reaction. whenever hear
brain-body distinction, just remind everybody really no


distinction brain body think nervous system.
nervous system brain, eyes, spinal cord, course

body brain, spinal cord, et cetera. describe neural circuits,
don't want think just things happening head, certainly
happening head, fact, circuits described detail exist within
confines cranial vault, nerd speak skull, circuits driving
particular predictions therefore particular biases towards particular actions
body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate
information allowed pass conscious experience,
not. gating mechanism strongly regulated chemical GABA. GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, say, serves shut suppress
activity neurons. thalamic reticular nucleus really saying, no, touch
information cannot come right now. not thinking contact
back legs chair sitting on, Andrew, thinking
trying say hearing voice sounds
see front you, et cetera. Whereas get injection


doctor pain, pleasure, going think somatic sensation
level touch probably going think less smells room, although
might also think smells room seeing hearing.
can combine different sensory modalities, thalamic reticular nucleus
really allows us funnel, direct particular categories sensory experience
conscious awareness suppress categories sensory experience. addition,
thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass
conscious perception ones not, much
neuroscientists indeed neurophilosophers, want call that,
theorized philosophized thalamic reticular nucleus actually involved
consciousness. Now, consciousness isn't topic really want talk
episode kind mushy-murky, say science, shmooey term
doesn't really clear definitions arguments often get lost
fact people arguing different things. say consciousness,
mean conscious awareness. zoom take look circuit
got now know based neuroimaging studies intimately involved
generating obsessions compulsions OCD. cortex neocortex,
involved perception understanding happening. striatum
basal ganglia, involved generating behaviors, go, suppressing
behaviors, no-go. thalamus collects sensory

hoping sharing this, might get insight whether

even seek help. commonly used test OCD, OCD, say,
called Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. is, scientists love
acronyms military, Y-BOCS, Y-B-O-C-S, Y-BOCS.
typically someone will go clinic either family member encouraged

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. SSRI? SSRI drug prevents re-uptake

relieve OCD significant degree. know that? gave
Y-BOCS test talked before, Yale-Brown test questions
read few. OCD severity one Y-BOCS

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least

cognitive behavioral, slash, exposure therapy done way detailed before,

fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.

week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects
libido. instance, can reduce sex drive, sometimes dose dependent way,
sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people

fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just

must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem
lead enhanced levels focus alertness day. perhaps
noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects

certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,

interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating

think really needs exploration nutraceuticals combination

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

particular predictions therefore particular biases towards particular actions
body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate
information allowed pass conscious experience,
not. gating mechanism strongly regulated chemical GABA. GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, say, serves shut suppress
activity neurons. thalamic reticular nucleus really saying, no, touch
information cannot come right now. not thinking contact
back legs chair sitting on, Andrew, thinking
trying say hearing voice sounds
see front you, et cetera. Whereas get injection


doctor pain, pleasure, going think somatic sensation
level touch probably going think less smells room, although
might also think smells room seeing hearing.
can combine different sensory modalities, thalamic reticular nucleus
really allows us funnel, direct particular categories sensory experience
conscious awareness suppress categories sensory experience. addition,
thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass
conscious perception ones not, much
neuroscientists indeed neurophilosophers, want call that,
theorized philosophized thalamic reticular nucleus actually involved
consciousness. Now, consciousness isn't topic really want talk
episode kind mushy-murky, say science, shmooey term
doesn't really clear definitions arguments often get lost
fact people arguing different things. say consciousness,
mean conscious awareness. zoom take look circuit
got now know based neuroimaging studies intimately involved
generating obsessions compulsions OCD. cortex neocortex,
involved perception understanding happening. striatum

Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD

foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively

states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions

ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols

papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long

people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try

excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean

also quite impressively explored happens people already taking

often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral

Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking

say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,
explored. study Dr. Blair Simpson looked this.
fairly small scale study. first all, give title. again, provide link.

remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety

ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger

nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor

helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff

tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people

fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near

reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things

SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side

depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing

happening head, fact, circuits described detail exist within

body. creating state readiness state desire check desire
count desire avoid et cetera, et cetera. circuits? Well,
lot wonderful research exploring neural circuit's underlying obsessive-
compulsive disorder mainly accomplished couple methods.
methods applied humans involve getting look
brain areas active people obsessions people
engaging compulsions. Now might seem simple do, course brain
housed inside cranial vault. order look inside it, use things like
magnetic resonance imaging, just fancy technology looking blood flow,
relates activation neurons, nerve cells, things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
nothing verb pet nothing house pet,
everything positron emission tomography, just another way seeing
brain areas active can also use PET figure sorts
neurochemicals active, like dopamine, et cetera. Many studies, can fairly say
dozens not hundreds studies, now identified particular circuit loop brain
areas interconnected active obsessive-compulsive disorder.
loop includes cortex, kind outer shell human brain. lumpy
stuff, sometimes appears, skull removed. involves area called
striatum involved action selection holding back action. striatum
involved commonly called go no-go types behaviors. every type
behavior like picking pen mug coffee involves go type function. involves
generating action. every time resist action, nervous system also
using brain structure, striatum, includes, among things,
basal ganglia. talked before. not trying overload
terminology here, know people interested terminology. go
behaviors no-go, resisting behaviors, not going toward behavior.


cortex striatum intricate back forth talk. really loops
connections. cortex doesn't tell striatum do, striatum doesn't tell
cortex do. crosstalk. Like good relationship, lot back
forth communication. third element cortico-striatal loop called,
thalamus. Now, thalamus not structure talked lot
podcast, one favorite structures think teach
neuroanatomy, teach back Stanford taught many years
elsewhere thalamus incredible egg-like structure center
brain different channels it. Channels relaying visual information
auditory information touch information environment cortex,
consequence, making certain things happening around
apparent you, making aware them, making perceive suppressing
others. instance, right now, hearing say this, thalamus
called auditory nuclei, collections neurons respond sound waves
course coming ears, thalamus active way
particular regions thalamus allowed, literally permitted pass
information coming ears steps thalamus,
auditory thalamus, cortex can hear saying right
now. time, thalamus surrounded kind shell, something
called thalamic reticular nucleus. Again, don't remember names,
thalamic reticular nucleus, also sometimes called reticular thalamic nucleus,
is, believe not, subject debate science. people literally hated
other, probably still hate other, even though one dead decades,
argue thalamic reticular nucleus, reticular
thalamic nucleus. Anyway, scientists, people, tend debate.
thalamic reticular nucleus, going call it, serves sort gate

neurotransmitter inhibitory, say, serves shut suppress

thalamic reticular nucleus plays critical role thoughts allowed pass

Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation

obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes

expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long

treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects
libido. instance, can reduce sex drive, sometimes dose dependent way,
sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way
illustrate kind step function look like. not gradual, immediate
given dose means. thing drugs will
transient effects. side effects show disappear sadly people will
sometimes take drugs side effects will surface later
weren't previously depending life factors, nutrition factors.
complicated landscape overall. really important explore kind
drug treatment, SSRI otherwise, really close communication psychiatrist

now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication

neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general

remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people

fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now

can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use

enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,

wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate

earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also

course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just

treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention

OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps

fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least
study, tell study is, Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005

fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.
alleviate OCD symptoms everybody? No. time consuming? Yes. Twice
week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

serotonin depleted humans low levels serotonin,
can see evidence cognitive inflexibility, challenges tasks, switching challenges

OCD. Again, one starts explore different transmitter systems
explored animal models humans, vast, vast landscape,
serotonergic drugs seem effective drugs treating OCD despite
fact, again, despite fact no direct evidence serotonin systems
problem OCD. recall cortico-striatal-thalamic loop central

actually say cognitive behavioral therapy taps serotonin system,
clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also
show reductions cortico-striatal-thalamic loops. basically situation
behavioral therapy works, many people, not all,
pretty good understanding works. increases anxiety tolerance,

weeks,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive

great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young

around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.

physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,

now, imagine enormous number additional

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. SSRI? SSRI drug prevents re-uptake

relieve OCD significant degree. know that? gave
Y-BOCS test talked before, Yale-Brown test questions
read few. OCD severity one Y-BOCS

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least
study, tell study is, Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005

combine them? Well, explored well, combination cognitive

cognitive behavioral, slash, exposure therapy done way detailed before,
twice week 12 weeks more. data, least study, point
fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.
alleviate OCD symptoms everybody? No. time consuming? Yes. Twice
week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects
libido. instance, can reduce sex drive, sometimes dose dependent way,
sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way
illustrate kind step function look like. not gradual, immediate

sometimes take drugs side effects will surface later
weren't previously depending life factors, nutrition factors.

actually say cognitive behavioral therapy taps serotonin system,
clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also
show reductions cortico-striatal-thalamic loops. basically situation
behavioral therapy works, many people, not all,
pretty good understanding works. increases anxiety tolerance,

weeks,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments

which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure
also going people YouTube comments section saying

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well
known associated stress system. Although every day, mention,
all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly
awakening. healthy increase cortisol. Late shift, mean, late day peaks


cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic

people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation

increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,

now, imagine enormous number additional

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.

things might not conscious qualify OCD. like
just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. SSRI? SSRI drug prevents re-uptake

12-week study done described before, two times week course 12

relieve OCD significant degree. know that? gave
Y-BOCS test talked before, Yale-Brown test questions
read few. OCD severity one Y-BOCS
measured terms index goes 8 way 28,
shouldn't mean anything. number eight kind meaningless here. terms

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least

fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.

week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects
libido. instance, can reduce sex drive, sometimes dose dependent way,
sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way

people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near

reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just

noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.

certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter

high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,

interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake

interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD

first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms

psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind

contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication

neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,

way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well
known associated stress system. Although every day, mention,
all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly

cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less
compete fashion production, derived molecule
cholesterol. certain biochemical pathways can either direct
cholesterol molecule toward cortisol synthesis testosterone synthesis, not both.
compete. cortisol goes general, not always, general,
testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship
cortisol testosterone, even tools try optimize

interesting aspect study not DHEA cortisol elevated females
OCD cortisol testosterone opposite effect, cortisol

GABA transmission altered net effect overall reduction GABA.
Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just

Going back inositol current use, say current use,

must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem
lead enhanced levels focus alertness day. perhaps
noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects
experiments actually stop taking inositol gastric discomfort gastric
distress called. reported results sleep kind anecdotal way.
certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating

think really needs exploration nutraceuticals combination
behavioral therapies.

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention

opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake

interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD

first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms

psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind

contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication

neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger

nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor

actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people

fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less

testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated

broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just

must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem

noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.

taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects

certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter

high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,

interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention

OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. SSRI? SSRI drug prevents re-uptake

relieve OCD significant degree. know that? gave
Y-BOCS test talked before, Yale-Brown test questions
read few. OCD severity one Y-BOCS

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least

homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk

obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

known associated stress system. Although every day, mention,
all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly

cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate

patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less

cholesterol. certain biochemical pathways can either direct
cholesterol molecule toward cortisol synthesis testosterone synthesis, not both.

testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship
cortisol testosterone, even tools try optimize

interesting aspect study not DHEA cortisol elevated females
OCD cortisol testosterone opposite effect, cortisol

GABA transmission altered net effect overall reduction GABA.
Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just
confess, first all, don't OCD, although will also confess

tick. six seven, recall trip Washington DC family,

Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol
explored bunch different contexts, including ticks OCD, et cetera.
Going back inositol current use, say current use,

must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem
lead enhanced levels focus alertness day. perhaps
noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects
experiments actually stop taking inositol gastric discomfort gastric
distress called. reported results sleep kind anecdotal way.
certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. SSRI? SSRI drug prevents re-uptake

relieve OCD significant degree. know that? gave
Y-BOCS test talked before, Yale-Brown test questions
read few. OCD severity one Y-BOCS

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least

cognitive behavioral, slash, exposure therapy done way detailed before,

fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.
alleviate OCD symptoms everybody? No. time consuming? Yes. Twice
week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects
libido. instance, can reduce sex drive, sometimes dose dependent way,
sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way

sometimes take drugs side effects will surface later

clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also

weeks,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,

wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can

mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus

SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side

depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention

opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,

thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least
study, tell study is, Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005

combine them? Well, explored well, combination cognitive

fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.
alleviate OCD symptoms everybody? No. time consuming? Yes. Twice
week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual

fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.

clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also

weeks,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive

available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young

around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.

physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,

wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus

SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side

depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. SSRI? SSRI drug prevents re-uptake

12-week study done described before, two times week course 12

relieve OCD significant degree. know that? gave
Y-BOCS test talked before, Yale-Brown test questions
read few. OCD severity one Y-BOCS
measured terms index goes 8 way 28,
shouldn't mean anything. number eight kind meaningless here. terms
index meaningful Y-BOCS, somebody threshold 16
higher, means still somewhat debilitating symptoms
debilitating symptoms. Placebo not reduce obsessions compulsions
significant degree. However, think quite excitingly, cognitive behavioral therapy
dramatic effect reducing obsessions compulsions four
weeks, score that, case, ranged 8 28, dropped way 25
11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least
study, tell study is, Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005
American Journal Psychiatry, also provide link can peruse
data like. least study, cognitive behavioral therapy
effective, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, less effective. happens
combine them? Well, explored well, combination cognitive
behavioral therapy SSRIs together not lead decrease OCD
symptoms. points idea cognitive behavioral therapy effective

cognitive behavioral, slash, exposure therapy done way detailed before,
twice week 12 weeks more. data, least study, point
fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.
alleviate OCD symptoms everybody? No. time consuming? Yes. Twice
week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean

Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way
illustrate kind step function look like. not gradual, immediate

sometimes take drugs side effects will surface later
weren't previously depending life factors, nutrition factors.

also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind

neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people

fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near

reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now

enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary

people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation

National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,

mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.

reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least

psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,
explored. study Dr. Blair Simpson looked this.
fairly small scale study. first all, give title. again, provide link.

data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety

ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,

way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things

SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects

SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side

depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now

01:10:18 CBT/Exposure Therapy & Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

things might not conscious qualify OCD. like
just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. SSRI? SSRI drug prevents re-uptake
serotonin synapse. synapses? little spaces neurons
neurons communicate one another vomiting little bits chemical
space, synapse, chemicals either evoke suppress electrical
activity next neuron across synapse. case, neurotransmitter,
chemical referring serotonin. SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake

vomiting, extrusion chemical synapse. consequence,
serotonin around effect time, net effect
serotonergic transmission, serotonin overall. not serotonin made,
serotonin available use, SSRI does. compared
cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs, also placebo group
cognitive behavioral therapy plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
12-week study done described before, two times week course 12
weeks. First all, important thing, course, placebo nothing. not


relieve OCD significant degree. know that? gave
Y-BOCS test talked before, Yale-Brown test questions
read few. OCD severity one Y-BOCS
measured terms index goes 8 way 28,
shouldn't mean anything. number eight kind meaningless here. terms
index meaningful Y-BOCS, somebody threshold 16
higher, means still somewhat debilitating symptoms
debilitating symptoms. Placebo not reduce obsessions compulsions
significant degree. However, think quite excitingly, cognitive behavioral therapy
dramatic effect reducing obsessions compulsions four
weeks, score that, case, ranged 8 28, dropped way 25
11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least
study, tell study is, Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005
American Journal Psychiatry, also provide link can peruse
data like. least study, cognitive behavioral therapy
effective, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, less effective. happens
combine them? Well, explored well, combination cognitive
behavioral therapy SSRIs together not lead decrease OCD
symptoms. points idea cognitive behavioral therapy effective
treatment. again, say cognitive behavioral therapy, now still referring
cognitive behavioral, slash, exposure therapy done way detailed before,
twice week 12 weeks more. data, least study, point
fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.
alleviate OCD symptoms everybody? No. time consuming? Yes. Twice
week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects
libido. instance, can reduce sex drive, sometimes dose dependent way,
sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way
illustrate kind step function look like. not gradual, immediate
given dose means. thing drugs will
transient effects. side effects show disappear sadly people will
sometimes take drugs side effects will surface later
weren't previously depending life factors, nutrition factors.
complicated landscape overall. really important explore kind
drug treatment, SSRI otherwise, really close communication psychiatrist
really understands pharmacokinetics

01:25:17 Serotonin & Cognitive Flexibility, Psilocybin Studies

lot patient history experience them. tell
next certainly going come big surprise, despite fact
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can effective reducing symptoms
OCD, least somewhat, certainly placebo, little,
evidence, serotonin system disrupted OCD. point
somewhat consistent theme field psychiatry, given drug can
effective even partially effective reducing symptoms changing overall
landscape psychiatric disorder illness, yet little, evidence,
particular system causal OCD, anxiety, depression, et cetera.
just landscape living terms understanding brain
psychiatry ways treating brain disorders. consequence,
huge number academic reviews clinicians research scientists
generated read share. One more, think, thorough ones recent years


published 2021. provide link this. excellent, truly excellent
researcher Yale university School Medicine, say not just researcher
clinician scientist, again, MD-PhD. Christopher Pittenger title

provide link it. just gorgeous review describing, just told you,
serotonin system isn't really disrupted OCD yet SSRIs can effective.
review goes explore even sorts receptors serotonin might involved.
fact case serotonin culprit creation OCD symptoms. Talk
serotonin 2A receptor serotonin 1A receptor. mentioning
detail? fact not clear, serotonin involved just tell right now,
currently lot interest whether not psychedelics, particular
psilocybin, can effective treatment OCD. Psilocybin shown

exploration psilocybin treatment OCD not yielded similar results,
although studies ongoing. Again, not yielded similar effectiveness,
studies ongoing serotonin 2A receptor serotonin 1A receptors
primary targets drug psilocybin. figured going
questions whether not psychedelics help OCD, thus far inconclusive.
part clinical trials knowledge intuition
relationship potential relationship, say, psilocybin
psychedelics OCD, please put comment section. love love hear
you. One thing point even though serotonin not
directly implicated OCD, serotonin general systems serotonin, circuits
brain carry serotonin depend shown impact cognitive
flexibility inflexibility, kind hallmark themes OCD. animals
serotonin depleted humans low levels serotonin,
can see evidence cognitive inflexibility, challenges tasks, switching challenges
switching rules one performs game, challenges kind cognitive
domain switching. indirectly implicate serotonin aspects


OCD. Again, one starts explore different transmitter systems
explored animal models humans, vast, vast landscape,
serotonergic drugs seem effective drugs treating OCD despite
fact, again, despite fact no direct evidence serotonin systems
problem OCD. recall cortico-striatal-thalamic loop central
etiology, presence patterns symptoms OCD, course, serotonin
impacting system. Serotonin impacting just every system brain,
no evidence tinkering serotonin levels, specifically network,
leading improvements OCD. However, people go FMRI scanner
people OCD evoke obsessions compulsions, see
activity cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. Treatments like SSRIs reduce
symptoms OCD equate situation less activity loop.
point cognitive behavioral therapy, no reason believe
taps serotonin system, think extreme stretch, false
actually say cognitive behavioral therapy taps serotonin system,
clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also
show reductions cortico-striatal-thalamic loops. basically situation
behavioral therapy works, many people, not all,
pretty good understanding works. increases anxiety tolerance,
interference pattern execution, getting people not engage sorts
behaviors detrimental them. drug treatments work least
degree, don't know work work brain. One
things really unifies behavioral treatments drug treatments
take period time. relief symptoms seems show around
four weeks certainly eight weeks cognitive behavioral therapy
SSRIs, really 10 12 week stage someone's twice
week, cognitive behavioral sessions, taking SSRI 10 12
weeks,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change
sort overall tonality. make likely less likely certain circuits will
active. can think kind activating playlists genres activity

will, analogy, discussions particular neurons. hear
SSRIs increase serotonin reduce symptoms OCD, neuroleptic reduces

reduces dopamine transmission, well, going motor effects
'cause dopamine involved generation motor sequences smooth limb
movement. people Parkinson's don't much dopamine will get
resting tremor, hard time generating smooth movement. side effects
start make sense, given huge number different neural circuits
different neuromodulators involved in. don't say discouraging, say
encourage patients careful systematic exploration different drug treatments
OCD always careful close guidance oversight psychiatrist
psychiatrists really understand side effect profiles make likely

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,
explored. study Dr. Blair Simpson looked this.
fairly small scale study. first all, give title. again, provide link.

cannabis marijuana cigarettes basically. total amount consumed,
believe, 800 milligrams. These, again, not suggestions. just simply
reporting study. can, again, provide link. looked OCD
symptoms, ratings. looked cardiovascular effects. large number
different things explored. say study done 2020,
first placebo-controlled investigation cannabis adults obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Pretty interesting. just reading conclusions here.
data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety
compared placebo. not see a, say positive effect, mean
ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure
also going people YouTube comments section saying
cannabis CBD helps OCD symptoms, least anticipate probably will.
Almost everything say here, somebody will contradict something
experience, encourage, way. want hear experience
certain things even not randomized placebo-controlled studies, still find
interesting know people experiencing. think
one better uses social media comment sections, able share
that, not advice-giving way prescriptive way,

01:39:29 Ketamine Treatment

simply way share encourage different types exploration.
sorts drug treatments gaining popularity OCD, least

see studies, please send me. Ketamine therapy, jury still out,

01:41:43 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)

psilocybin, jury still out. early days. Another treatment becoming
somewhat common, least people commonly excited transcranial

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just

No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.

certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,

high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,

interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms

think really needs exploration nutraceuticals combination

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely

Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new

actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures

states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions

ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols

people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try

often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean

Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD

combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.

think safe say drugs use dosage whether not

fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize

oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger

way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns

nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive

great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young

physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic

people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation

increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,

times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate

Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment

just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake

11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least

psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects
libido. instance, can reduce sex drive, sometimes dose dependent way,
sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way

sometimes take drugs side effects will surface later

you. One thing point even though serotonin not
directly implicated OCD, serotonin general systems serotonin, circuits
brain carry serotonin depend shown impact cognitive
flexibility inflexibility, kind hallmark themes OCD. animals
serotonin depleted humans low levels serotonin,
can see evidence cognitive inflexibility, challenges tasks, switching challenges
switching rules one performs game, challenges kind cognitive
domain switching. indirectly implicate serotonin aspects


OCD. Again, one starts explore different transmitter systems
explored animal models humans, vast, vast landscape,
serotonergic drugs seem effective drugs treating OCD despite
fact, again, despite fact no direct evidence serotonin systems
problem OCD. recall cortico-striatal-thalamic loop central
etiology, presence patterns symptoms OCD, course, serotonin
impacting system. Serotonin impacting just every system brain,
no evidence tinkering serotonin levels, specifically network,

point cognitive behavioral therapy, no reason believe
taps serotonin system, think extreme stretch, false
actually say cognitive behavioral therapy taps serotonin system,
clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also
show reductions cortico-striatal-thalamic loops. basically situation
behavioral therapy works, many people, not all,
pretty good understanding works. increases anxiety tolerance,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger

think jumping off. fact nervous system,

nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part

tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people

fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less

testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just

No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.

consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects

certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

things might conscious

01:10:18 CBT/Exposure Therapy & Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

things might not conscious qualify OCD. like
just briefly summarize key elements cognitive behavioral therapy exposure
therapy can combined drug treatments effective.
Much going talk next relates data indeed practice
incredible research scientist clinician. Helen Blair Simpson,
say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, indeed MD medical doctor PhD
research scientist Columbia University School Medicine. one world's
foremost experts, not expert, put category maybe just one
three people knowledgeable mechanisms OCD, actively
researching OCD humans, trying find new treatments, trying unveil new
mechanisms expand current understanding also treats OCD quite
actively clinic. Dr. Simpson gave beautiful presentation
summarized core elements CBT exposure therapy treatment
obsessive-compulsive disorders. describes key procedures
exposures, course, done person actual thing evokes
obsessions compulsions. sweaty towel described earlier,
number different triggers done patient real time, vivo,
say. also things imaginal, sitting somebody chair,
office saying, okay, want imagine thing triggers intrusive
thought, just focus intrusive thought arises, explore
expose patient obsessions compulsions way. can real,
can imaginal. goal, course, gradually progressively increase
level anxiety, intervene so-called ritual prevention prevent
person engaging compulsion. goals, paraphrasing here, to,
states, disconfirm fears challenge beliefs obsessions
compulsions, intervene thoughts behaviors, break habit
ritualizing avoiding. Now, typically done? nuts bolts


procedure? Typically, done two planning sessions patient.
describing patient will happen will happen long will
happen not just thrown blue. 15 exposure
sessions done twice week more. one thing really understand
cognitive behavioral therapy can take period time, several
weeks, many 10 12 weeks. However, soon learn, many drug
treatments effective treating OCD either alone combination
behavioral therapies also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks longer, many never
work all. even though 10 12 weeks seems like long period time, actually
pretty standard. like see complete description protocols
cognitive behavioral therapy exposure therapy OCD, provide links two
papers, Kozak Foa, F-O-A, published 1997, might seem like long
time ago, nonetheless, protocols still useful. second
paper last author, FOA et al 2012 provide links those.
addition, Dr. Blair Simpson others explored best treatments
patients OCD comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,
essentially no intervention something takes equivalent amount time
not thought effective treatment. well selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. SSRI? SSRI drug prevents re-uptake
serotonin synapse. synapses? little spaces neurons

serotonin available use, SSRI does. compared
cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs, also placebo group
cognitive behavioral therapy plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
12-week study done described before, two times week course 12
weeks. First all, important thing, course, placebo nothing. not


relieve OCD significant degree. know that? gave
Y-BOCS test talked before, Yale-Brown test questions
read few. OCD severity one Y-BOCS
measured terms index goes 8 way 28,
shouldn't mean anything. number eight kind meaningless here. terms
index meaningful Y-BOCS, somebody threshold 16
higher, means still somewhat debilitating symptoms
debilitating symptoms. Placebo not reduce obsessions compulsions
significant degree. However, think quite excitingly, cognitive behavioral therapy
dramatic effect reducing obsessions compulsions four
weeks, score that, case, ranged 8 28, dropped way 25
11. huge drop severity symptoms. Now, really
interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD
symptoms, significant effect reducing symptoms OCD showed
first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms
still much greater receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. least
study, tell study is, Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005
American Journal Psychiatry, also provide link can peruse
data like. least study, cognitive behavioral therapy
effective, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, less effective. happens
combine them? Well, explored well, combination cognitive
behavioral therapy SSRIs together not lead decrease OCD
symptoms. points idea cognitive behavioral therapy effective
treatment. again, say cognitive behavioral therapy, now still referring
cognitive behavioral, slash, exposure therapy done way detailed before,
twice week 12 weeks more. data, least study, point
fact cognitive behavioral therapy really effective effective.
alleviate OCD symptoms everybody? No. time consuming? Yes. Twice
week two sessions 15 minutes, sometimes office, plus
homework, plus, ideal case, also home visits psychiatrist


psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects
libido. instance, can reduce sex drive, sometimes dose dependent way,
sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way
illustrate kind step function look like. not gradual, immediate
given dose means. thing drugs will
transient effects. side effects show disappear sadly people will
sometimes take drugs side effects will surface later
weren't previously depending life factors, nutrition factors.
complicated landscape overall. really important explore kind
drug treatment, SSRI otherwise, really close communication psychiatrist
really understands pharmacokinetics

01:25:17 Serotonin & Cognitive Flexibility, Psilocybin Studies

lot patient history experience them. tell
next certainly going come big surprise, despite fact
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can effective reducing symptoms
OCD, least somewhat, certainly placebo, little,
evidence, serotonin system disrupted OCD. point
somewhat consistent theme field psychiatry, given drug can
effective even partially effective reducing symptoms changing overall
landscape psychiatric disorder illness, yet little, evidence,

just landscape living terms understanding brain
psychiatry ways treating brain disorders. consequence,
huge number academic reviews clinicians research scientists
generated read share. One more, think, thorough ones recent years


published 2021. provide link this. excellent, truly excellent
researcher Yale university School Medicine, say not just researcher
clinician scientist, again, MD-PhD. Christopher Pittenger title

provide link it. just gorgeous review describing, just told you,
serotonin system isn't really disrupted OCD yet SSRIs can effective.
review goes explore even sorts receptors serotonin might involved.
fact case serotonin culprit creation OCD symptoms. Talk
serotonin 2A receptor serotonin 1A receptor. mentioning
detail? fact not clear, serotonin involved just tell right now,
currently lot interest whether not psychedelics, particular
psilocybin, can effective treatment OCD. Psilocybin shown

exploration psilocybin treatment OCD not yielded similar results,
although studies ongoing. Again, not yielded similar effectiveness,

questions whether not psychedelics help OCD, thus far inconclusive.
part clinical trials knowledge intuition
relationship potential relationship, say, psilocybin
psychedelics OCD, please put comment section. love love hear
you. One thing point even though serotonin not
directly implicated OCD, serotonin general systems serotonin, circuits
brain carry serotonin depend shown impact cognitive
flexibility inflexibility, kind hallmark themes OCD. animals
serotonin depleted humans low levels serotonin,
can see evidence cognitive inflexibility, challenges tasks, switching challenges
switching rules one performs game, challenges kind cognitive
domain switching. indirectly implicate serotonin aspects


OCD. Again, one starts explore different transmitter systems
explored animal models humans, vast, vast landscape,
serotonergic drugs seem effective drugs treating OCD despite
fact, again, despite fact no direct evidence serotonin systems
problem OCD. recall cortico-striatal-thalamic loop central
etiology, presence patterns symptoms OCD, course, serotonin
impacting system. Serotonin impacting just every system brain,
no evidence tinkering serotonin levels, specifically network,
leading improvements OCD. However, people go FMRI scanner
people OCD evoke obsessions compulsions, see
activity cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. Treatments like SSRIs reduce
symptoms OCD equate situation less activity loop.
point cognitive behavioral therapy, no reason believe
taps serotonin system, think extreme stretch, false
actually say cognitive behavioral therapy taps serotonin system,
clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also
show reductions cortico-striatal-thalamic loops. basically situation
behavioral therapy works, many people, not all,
pretty good understanding works. increases anxiety tolerance,
interference pattern execution, getting people not engage sorts
behaviors detrimental them. drug treatments work least
degree, don't know work work brain. One
things really unifies behavioral treatments drug treatments
take period time. relief symptoms seems show around
four weeks certainly eight weeks cognitive behavioral therapy
SSRIs, really 10 12 week stage someone's twice
week, cognitive behavioral sessions, taking SSRI 10 12
weeks,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change
sort overall tonality. make likely less likely certain circuits will

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal

data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety
compared placebo. not see a, say positive effect, mean
ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure
also going people YouTube comments section saying
cannabis CBD helps OCD symptoms, least anticipate probably will.
Almost everything say here, somebody will contradict something

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people

fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near

reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use

enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people

Now different results described laboratory

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change
sort overall tonality. make likely less likely certain circuits will

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,
explored. study Dr. Blair Simpson looked this.
fairly small scale study. first all, give title. again, provide link.
entitled, Acute effects cannabinoids symptoms obsessive-compulsive
disorder: human laboratory study. briefly, 14 adults OCD.

others 7% THC, groups is, 0.4% CBD THC.
looked CBD. know lot people interested CBD. one
studies find explored different percentages THC CBD
cannabis marijuana cigarettes basically. total amount consumed,
believe, 800 milligrams. These, again, not suggestions. just simply
reporting study. can, again, provide link. looked OCD
symptoms, ratings. looked cardiovascular effects. large number
different things explored. say study done 2020,
first placebo-controlled investigation cannabis adults obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Pretty interesting. just reading conclusions here.
data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety
compared placebo. not see a, say positive effect, mean
ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure
also going people YouTube comments section saying
cannabis CBD helps OCD symptoms, least anticipate probably will.
Almost everything say here, somebody will contradict something
experience, encourage, way. want hear experience
certain things even not randomized placebo-controlled studies, still find
interesting know people experiencing. think
one better uses social media comment sections, able share
that, not advice-giving way prescriptive way,

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well

all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly

cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less

testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated

broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels

neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing

interesting look effects SSRIs treatment OCD

first four weeks, continued eight weeks. fact,
progressive reduction OCD symptoms four eight week period.
Again, people just taking SSRI, sort flattened little
bit, 12 weeks, still significant reduction OCD symptoms
people taking SSRIs compared placebo. severity symptoms

psychologist, lot investment, lot time investment, say nothing
potential financial investment. Now, Dr. Blair Simpson given beautiful talks
describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects
libido. instance, can reduce sex drive, sometimes dose dependent way,
sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way
illustrate kind step function look like. not gradual, immediate
given dose means. thing drugs will
transient effects. side effects show disappear sadly people will
sometimes take drugs side effects will surface later
weren't previously depending life factors, nutrition factors.
complicated landscape overall. really important explore kind
drug treatment, SSRI otherwise, really close communication psychiatrist
really understands pharmacokinetics

actually say cognitive behavioral therapy taps serotonin system,
clearly going affect huge number circuits neurochemical systems. Well,
people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also
show reductions cortico-striatal-thalamic loops. basically situation
behavioral therapy works, many people, not all,
pretty good understanding works. increases anxiety tolerance,

weeks,

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational

different things explored. say study done 2020,
first placebo-controlled investigation cannabis adults obsessive-

data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety
compared placebo. not see a, say positive effect, mean
ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure
also going people YouTube comments section saying
cannabis CBD helps OCD symptoms, least anticipate probably will.
Almost everything say here, somebody will contradict something

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near

reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use

enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic

people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation

mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

describes data also emphasizes fact despite
demonstrated power cognitive behavioral therapy treatment OCD,
people given drug treatments simply availability drug
treatments. Now, say people, want emphasize referring
people actually go seek treatment really important thing realize
people OCD not actually go seek evidence-based treatment. want
repeat that, people OCD not seek evidence-based treatment,
tragic thing. One motivations podcast episode try
encourage people think may persistent obsessions compulsions
seek treatment, people don't variety reasons spelled earlier,
shame, et cetera. do, first line attack typically prescription,
often SSRI, although not always just SSRIs soon talk
somewhat common use also prescribing low dose neuroleptic
antipsychotic, not always often. important thing understand
excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson understand treatments
say best ideal based data, doesn't necessarily mean
deployed often general public. consequence, Dr.
Simpson others explored practical way whether not matters
somebody getting SSRI treatment experiencing reduction OCD
symptoms may recall, experience placebo
alone, not dramatic reduction OCD symptoms get
cognitive behavioral therapy. mentioned before, exploration
combining drug treatment cognitive behavioral therapy outset,
also quite impressively explored happens people already taking
SSRIs initiate cognitive behavioral therapy. really wonderful thing
done that, first all, acknowledging many
people sought treatment getting relief
SSRIs, perhaps not much relief get. actively
acknowledging many people getting drug treatments first. fact,
often people getting drug treatments first. happens add
cognitive behavioral therapy? Well, good news add cognitive behavioral
therapy someone already taking SSRIs, improves symptoms.


Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects

sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause

people cognitive behavioral therapy find relief OCD, also

01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators

really significant reduction OCD symptoms starts really show up. Now,
now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general

circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,

different things explored. say study done 2020,
first placebo-controlled investigation cannabis adults obsessive-

data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety
compared placebo. not see a, say positive effect, mean
ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure
also going people YouTube comments section saying
cannabis CBD helps OCD symptoms, least anticipate probably will.
Almost everything say here, somebody will contradict something
experience, encourage, way. want hear experience
certain things even not randomized placebo-controlled studies, still find
interesting know people experiencing. think
one better uses social media comment sections, able share
that, not advice-giving way prescriptive way,

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well
known associated stress system. Although every day, mention,
all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly

cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less
compete fashion production, derived molecule
cholesterol. certain biochemical pathways can either direct
cholesterol molecule toward cortisol synthesis testosterone synthesis, not both.
compete. cortisol goes general, not always, general,
testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship
cortisol testosterone, even tools try optimize

interesting aspect study not DHEA cortisol elevated females
OCD cortisol testosterone opposite effect, cortisol

GABA transmission altered net effect overall reduction GABA.
Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just
confess, first all, don't OCD, although will also confess

tick. six seven, recall trip Washington DC family,
feeling strong desire need even recall, grunt order clear

tension. remember dad time telling don't that. Don't that,
not good grunt something like that. think saw kind compulsive

Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol
explored bunch different contexts, including ticks OCD, et cetera.
Going back inositol current use, say current use,

taking 900 milligrams myo-inositol either alone combination sleep kit.
must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem
lead enhanced levels focus alertness day. perhaps
noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects
experiments actually stop taking inositol gastric discomfort gastric
distress called. reported results sleep kind anecdotal way.
certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating
supplement protocol. think great future nutraceuticals, meaning
think systematic exploration particular lower dosages context OCD

think really needs exploration nutraceuticals combination
behavioral therapies.

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

Now different results described laboratory
fact, combine cognitive behavioral therapy SSRIs outset,
no additional benefit SSRI. However, just described, someone already taking
SSRI experiencing reduction OCD symptoms, adding
cognitive behavioral therapy, reduction symptoms OCD.
important. sought treatment taking
SSRI, thinking treatment prescribed SSRI, ideal
scenario really combine drug treatment cognitive behavioral
therapy, cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone, although
decision really make close advice oversight licensed
physician, because, course, prescription drugs. anytime going
add remove prescription drug change dosage, really want close
discussion advice physician. don't just say protect me,
say protect 'cause just right thing do. again, cognitive behavioral
therapy extremely powerful. Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

01:22:30 Considerations SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments

already drug treatment, adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really
help. talking SSRIs described little bit work
kind superficial level keeping serotonin synapse serotonin
can action opposed gobbled back neurons. just mention
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are. things like
clomipramine, not entirely selective, say one generally falls
category less selective. can impair can enhance
neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera. selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, least classic ones are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
fluvoxamine, Luvox, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
six classic SSRIs, like citalopram used children
available pediatric doses. like Prozac may may not used children.
details SSRIs, et cetera, extensive literature discussion.
think safe say drugs use dosage whether not
continue, excuse me, dosage time depends lot individual
variation people express responses have. drugs,


fact, think can say drugs side effects. question detrimental
side effects daily life. SSRIs well known effects appetite.
cases, abolish appetite. cases, just reduce little bit.
cases, increase appetite. Really highly individual. can effects
libido. instance, can reduce sex drive, sometimes dose dependent way,
sometimes way like step function people fine say 5 10
milligrams, get 15 milligrams cliff libido. can
happen, really depends. Please don't take dosages exact values 'cause
going depend used for, depression anxiety OCD,
also going depend drug, et cetera. just threw numbers way
illustrate kind step function look like. not gradual, immediate
given dose means. thing drugs will
transient effects. side effects show disappear sadly people will
sometimes take drugs side effects will surface later
weren't previously depending life factors, nutrition factors.
complicated landscape overall. really important explore kind

neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,
explored. study Dr. Blair Simpson looked this.
fairly small scale study. first all, give title. again, provide link.

different things explored. say study done 2020,
first placebo-controlled investigation cannabis adults obsessive-

data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety
compared placebo. not see a, say positive effect, mean
ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger

nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor

helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people

fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,

wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others

particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful

it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

now, talking fact people getting relief


treatments, sadly, case OCD, significant population simply
not respond CBT SSRIs, combination, psychiatrists
also explore combination SSRIs neuroleptics drugs tap so-
called dopamine system glutamate system. neurotransmitters
neuromodulators impact different circuits brain. just really remind
neurotransmitters neuromodulators do, important
contextualize this, neurotransmitters typically involved rapid communication
neurons. two common neurotransmitters
neurotransmitter glutamate, say excitatory, meaning released
synapse, causes next neuron active, active, GABA
neurotransmitter inhibitory, meaning released synapse,
typically, not always, typically, GABA going encourage next neuron
less electrically active even silence activity. neuromodulators, contrast,
not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general
patterns activity brain, making certain circuits likely active
circuits less likely active. say dopamine X dopamine Y,
serotonin X serotonin Y, don't really one thing, change

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,
explored. study Dr. Blair Simpson looked this.
fairly small scale study. first all, give title. again, provide link.
entitled, Acute effects cannabinoids symptoms obsessive-compulsive

others 7% THC, groups is, 0.4% CBD THC.
looked CBD. know lot people interested CBD. one
studies find explored different percentages THC CBD
cannabis marijuana cigarettes basically. total amount consumed,
believe, 800 milligrams. These, again, not suggestions. just simply
reporting study. can, again, provide link. looked OCD
symptoms, ratings. looked cardiovascular effects. large number
different things explored. say study done 2020,
first placebo-controlled investigation cannabis adults obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Pretty interesting. just reading conclusions here.
data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety
compared placebo. not see a, say positive effect, mean
ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure
also going people YouTube comments section saying
cannabis CBD helps OCD symptoms, least anticipate probably will.
Almost everything say here, somebody will contradict something
experience, encourage, way. want hear experience
certain things even not randomized placebo-controlled studies, still find
interesting know people experiencing. think
one better uses social media comment sections, able share

psilocybin, jury still out. early days. Another treatment becoming
somewhat common, least people commonly excited transcranial

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,

mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus

depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely

OCD. Again, one starts explore different transmitter systems
explored animal models humans, vast, vast landscape,
serotonergic drugs seem effective drugs treating OCD despite
fact, again, despite fact no direct evidence serotonin systems

not neurotransmitters, neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
acetylcholine others operate little bit differently. tend act little bit
broadly. can act within synapse, can also change general

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well
known associated stress system. Although every day, mention,
all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly
awakening. healthy increase cortisol. Late shift, mean, late day peaks


cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less
compete fashion production, derived molecule
cholesterol. certain biochemical pathways can either direct
cholesterol molecule toward cortisol synthesis testosterone synthesis, not both.
compete. cortisol goes general, not always, general,
testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship
cortisol testosterone, even tools try optimize

testosterone estrogen, hubermanlab.com. Now, say
interesting aspect study not DHEA cortisol elevated females
OCD cortisol testosterone opposite effect, cortisol
testosterone males OCD, rather relationship those,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. terms GABA, GABA inhibitory
neurotransmitter tends quiet certain neuronal pathways, different things

slightly elevated. situation pattern hormones

GABA transmission altered net effect overall reduction GABA.
Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may
seen before. certainly have, dramatic actually quite

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just
confess, first all, don't OCD, although will also confess

tension. remember dad time telling don't that. Don't that,
not good grunt something like that. think saw kind compulsive

Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol
explored bunch different contexts, including ticks OCD, et cetera.
Going back inositol current use, say current use,

taking 900 milligrams myo-inositol either alone combination sleep kit.
must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem
lead enhanced levels focus alertness day. perhaps
noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects
experiments actually stop taking inositol gastric discomfort gastric
distress called. reported results sleep kind anecdotal way.
certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating

think systematic exploration particular lower dosages context OCD

think really needs exploration nutraceuticals combination
behavioral therapies.

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,
explored. study Dr. Blair Simpson looked this.
fairly small scale study. first all, give title. again, provide link.
entitled, Acute effects cannabinoids symptoms obsessive-compulsive

cannabis marijuana cigarettes basically. total amount consumed,
believe, 800 milligrams. These, again, not suggestions. just simply
reporting study. can, again, provide link. looked OCD
symptoms, ratings. looked cardiovascular effects. large number
different things explored. say study done 2020,
first placebo-controlled investigation cannabis adults obsessive-

data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety
compared placebo. not see a, say positive effect, mean
ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure
also going people YouTube comments section saying
cannabis CBD helps OCD symptoms, least anticipate probably will.
Almost everything say here, somebody will contradict something

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger

think jumping off. fact nervous system,

way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated

OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things

SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects

SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side

depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize

01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD

not sort thing want cowboy go try figure yourself.
Now, also want acknowledge forms drug treatments.
touched psilocybin briefly, forms drug treatments
explored OCD. Earlier, talked little bit cannabis.
cannabis place exploration all? Well, first all, number people try self
medicate OCD. clinical evidence, not talking recreational
use, talking clinical evidence cannabis can reduce anxiety. Now earlier
talking not reducing anxiety, learning anxiety tolerance order deal
treat OCD context cognitive behavioral therapies. doesn't
necessarily rule cannabis candidate treatment OCD. fact,
explored. study Dr. Blair Simpson looked this.
fairly small scale study. first all, give title. again, provide link.

cannabis marijuana cigarettes basically. total amount consumed,
believe, 800 milligrams. These, again, not suggestions. just simply
reporting study. can, again, provide link. looked OCD
symptoms, ratings. looked cardiovascular effects. large number
different things explored. say study done 2020,
first placebo-controlled investigation cannabis adults obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Pretty interesting. just reading conclusions here.
data suggests smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC CBD,
remember looked different concentrations those, little acute impact,
meaning immediate impact OCD symptoms yield smaller reductions anxiety
compared placebo. not see a, say positive effect, mean
ameliorative effect, effect reducing symptoms OCD cannabis CBD,
which, unfortunate. think unfortunate anytime treatment doesn't work.
nonetheless, data, sure going studies. sure
also going people YouTube comments section saying
cannabis CBD helps OCD symptoms, least anticipate probably will.
Almost everything say here, somebody will contradict something

certain things even not randomized placebo-controlled studies, still find
interesting know people experiencing. think
one better uses social media comment sections, able share
that, not advice-giving way prescriptive way,

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well
known associated stress system. Although every day, mention,
all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly
awakening. healthy increase cortisol. Late shift, mean, late day peaks


cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less
compete fashion production, derived molecule
cholesterol. certain biochemical pathways can either direct
cholesterol molecule toward cortisol synthesis testosterone synthesis, not both.
compete. cortisol goes general, not always, general,
testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship
cortisol testosterone, even tools try optimize

interesting aspect study not DHEA cortisol elevated females
OCD cortisol testosterone opposite effect, cortisol

slightly elevated. situation pattern hormones
females males OCD different people without OCD
GABA transmission altered net effect overall reduction GABA.
Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may
seen before. certainly have, dramatic actually quite

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger

think jumping off. fact nervous system,

way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards

actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence

cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things

SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side

depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural

amino acid, glutamate, neurotransmitter, so-called NMDA, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor, receptor special nervous system
glutamate binds NMDA receptor, tends offer opportunity

yet. smaller studies happened revealed patients get
relief ketamine therapy OCD, nothing overwhelmingly pointing
fact ketamine magic bullet OCD treatment. cannabis, CBD, least
now, even though one smaller study, no real evidence can alleviate
OCD symptoms. new studies published soon, sure update you.
see studies, please send me. Ketamine therapy, jury still out,

really important point, not just sake discussion obsessive-compulsive

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well
known associated stress system. Although every day, mention,
all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly
awakening. healthy increase cortisol. Late shift, mean, late day peaks


cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less

cholesterol. certain biochemical pathways can either direct
cholesterol molecule toward cortisol synthesis testosterone synthesis, not both.
compete. cortisol goes general, not always, general,
testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship
cortisol testosterone, even tools try optimize

interesting aspect study not DHEA cortisol elevated females
OCD cortisol testosterone opposite effect, cortisol

slightly elevated. situation pattern hormones

GABA transmission altered net effect overall reduction GABA.
Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may
seen before. certainly have, dramatic actually quite

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch

irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well
known associated stress system. Although every day, mention,
all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly
awakening. healthy increase cortisol. Late shift, mean, late day peaks


cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less
compete fashion production, derived molecule
cholesterol. certain biochemical pathways can either direct
cholesterol molecule toward cortisol synthesis testosterone synthesis, not both.
compete. cortisol goes general, not always, general,
testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship
cortisol testosterone, even tools try optimize

interesting aspect study not DHEA cortisol elevated females
OCD cortisol testosterone opposite effect, cortisol

GABA transmission altered net effect overall reduction GABA.
Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational

next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate

01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus

combined SSRIs cognitive behavioral therapy real bulk
data are. want make one additional point cannabis CBD relates
obsessive-compulsive disorder. me, not surprising cannabis CBD
not improve symptoms OCD. discussion Dr. Paul Conti
weeks ago, mention, Dr. Conti indeed medical doctor, psychiatrist,
talking cannabis various uses, clinical
applications. mentioned one main effects cannabis tighten
focus enhance concentration thoughts one particular thing.
cases can clinically beneficial, cases can clinically
detrimental. accept idea cannabis increases focus, think
OCD networks involved, think anxiety relationship
obsession compulsion, well, shouldn't come surprise
cannabis not improve symptoms OCD anything, increase
focus obsessions compulsions. Now not observed.
not see exacerbation worsening symptoms OCD cannabis,
least not read data, not see improvement OCD
symptoms cannabis CBD.



01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,
prediction machine, oftentimes testing possibilities. sometimes testing goes
way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns
inside us. big difference thought action that, course,
nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize


that, first all, not crazy. not thinking feeling stuff
bad evil. course, sometimes can cross elements
life place moral judgment people certain behaviors. think part
healthy society, course, laws punishments rewards
matter certain types behaviors. idea thoughts not bad
actions thoughts can tolerated anxiety around thoughts can
tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can
detrimental. course want sensitive that, really comes
it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.
subjects 18 49 years old, controls age sex matched
healthy volunteers. Again, no OCD. basic takeaway study?
basic takeaway study females OCD, evidence
significantly elevated cortisol DHEA. Now interesting cortisol well
known associated stress system. Although every day, mention,
all, male female, everybody experiences increase cortisol shortly
awakening. healthy increase cortisol. Late shift, mean, late day peaks


cortisol shift cortisol peak later day known correlate
depression anxiety disorders. fact cortisol elevated DHEA
elevated female patients OCD suggests cortisol either reflective
causal increase anxiety. don't know direction effect. Now male
patients OCD, evidence increased cortisol. Again, not surprising given
role anxiety cortisol, say, given role cortisol anxiety
increasing anxiety seen OCD, also significant reductions testosterone,
also not surprise us cortisol testosterone less
compete fashion production, derived molecule
cholesterol. certain biochemical pathways can either direct
cholesterol molecule toward cortisol synthesis testosterone synthesis, not both.
compete. cortisol goes general, not always, general,
testosterone goes vice versa. want learn relationship
cortisol testosterone, even tools try optimize

interesting aspect study not DHEA cortisol elevated females
OCD cortisol testosterone opposite effect, cortisol

GABA transmission altered net effect overall reduction GABA.
Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated
lower levels anxiety, tends create balance within various neural circuits. Now,
broad statement, know instance, epilepsy, GABA levels
reduced therefore get runaway excitation certain circuits brain,
therefore seizures, either petite mal, mini seizures, grand mal, massive seizures,


even drop seizures people completely collapse floor seizure. may

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just
confess, first all, don't OCD, although will also confess
child, transient tick. talked podcast before. grunting
tick. six seven, recall trip Washington DC family,
feeling strong desire need even recall, grunt order clear
something throat, didn't anything throat. didn't cold
postnasal drip, really just feeling needed that, release sort
tension. remember dad time telling don't that. Don't that,
not good grunt something like that. think saw kind compulsive
behavior. actually hide back seat rental car it,
hide room. Fortunately me, transient, think six months year
later, disappeared. Although notice, actually ex-girlfriend mine point
get tired working long hours, sometimes grunting tick
will reappear. mean? Tourette's? don't know, maybe.
never diagnosed Tourette's. OCD? Maybe. certainly accused
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, talk still
minutes. point many children transiently express ticks low level
Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol
explored bunch different contexts, including ticks OCD, et cetera.
Going back inositol current use, say current use,
taking 900 milligrams inositol addition existing toolkit sleep,
talked many times podcast podcasts, consists magnesium


threonate, apigenin, theanine. want know kit, can go
newsletter, Neural Network Newsletter hubermanlab.com. toolkit sleep
there. don't even sign newsletter it'll give flavor
sorts things newsletter. case, experimenting bit
taking 900 milligrams myo-inositol either alone combination sleep kit.
must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem
lead enhanced levels focus alertness day. perhaps
noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects
experiments actually stop taking inositol gastric discomfort gastric
distress called. reported results sleep kind anecdotal way.
certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating
supplement protocol. think great future nutraceuticals, meaning
think systematic exploration particular lower dosages context OCD
treatment. saw SSRIs prescription drug treatments,
think really needs exploration nutraceuticals combination
behavioral therapies.

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond

opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting

01:47:50 Thoughts Not Actions

me, not surprising given cannabis CBD seems increase focus. Next,
like talk research roles hormones OCD,
turns interesting relationship there. do, want
point something realize probably said earlier, one
key things someone OCD come understand going experience
relief symptoms, whether not drug treatments behavioral
treatments otherwise, thoughts not bad actions. Thoughts not
bad actions. One kind rules people OCD seem adopt
thoughts really, truly equivalent actions.
intrusive thought and, haven't spent much time today, earlier touched
fact intrusive thoughts people OCD really
disturbing. can really gross, least gross person. can evoke
imagery toxic infectious, highly sexualized way disturbing
them, can taboo. not uncommon start talking people
OCD start pulling thread. Again, psychiatrist
trained ask right questions gain comfort trust patient.
start reveal thoughts really intrusive kind disturbing,
feel compelled try suppress behaviors. One powerful
elements treatment OCD really support patient make realize
thoughts just thoughts everyone disturbing thoughts.
oftentimes disturbing thoughts arise inconvenient, sometimes,
seems like inappropriate circumstances. relates whole larger
discussion thoughts surface,
come stand edge bridge, even not want jump off,
think jumping off. fact nervous system,

way off Netherlands thought patterns emotional patterns

nervous system is, one case, not translating patterns thinking motor
sequences. nerdy way saying thoughts aren't actions, believe not, can
helpful people really think use opportunity realize

tolerated time can diminish, powerful hallmark theme
treatment OCD remiss didn't mention it. Thoughts not actions. Actions
can harm us, can harm people, can soak enormous amounts time.
Thoughts can soak enormous amounts time. can troubling. can

it, first step treatment OCD realization

01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA

approach realization thoughts not bad actions.
hormones OCD? Well, explored, albeit not extensively
would've liked find, went literature, found one particularly
interesting study, entitled, Neurosteroid Levels Patients Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. First author, Erbay always, provide link study.
objective study explore serum within blood, neurosteroid levels people
OCD. Why? Well, relationship OCD anxiety
fact stress-related disorders anxiety depression, hormones
extensively explored, not much OCD, least study.
compared serum levels number different hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone,
DHEA, cortisol, testosterone. done 30 patients OCD 30 healthy
controls. not huge study, enough draw pretty nice conclusions.

Now GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter, broadly speaking associated

neurotransmitters, just described, neuromodulators
neurotransmitters play intimate role generation treatment things like
OCD, stands reason manipulations hormone systems, however subtle
dramatic might, want highlight, might prove useful adjusting symptoms
OCD hope area researchers going pursue near
future many treatments reducing DHEA increasing testosterone
reducing cortisol already made FDA approval. there,
readily prescribed. Many already generic form means
patents already lapsed first versions drugs.
available generic drugs, often, available significantly lower cost.
whole discussion patent laws prescription drugs.
drugs largely available prescription yet generic form, think
great opportunity explore hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, DHA,
huge category hormones might impact symptoms OCD, especially since


many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just
confess, first all, don't OCD, although will also confess
child, transient tick. talked podcast before. grunting
tick. six seven, recall trip Washington DC family,
feeling strong desire need even recall, grunt order clear
something throat, didn't anything throat. didn't cold
postnasal drip, really just feeling needed that, release sort
tension. remember dad time telling don't that. Don't that,
not good grunt something like that. think saw kind compulsive
behavior. actually hide back seat rental car it,
hide room. Fortunately me, transient, think six months year
later, disappeared. Although notice, actually ex-girlfriend mine point
get tired working long hours, sometimes grunting tick
will reappear. mean? Tourette's? don't know, maybe.
never diagnosed Tourette's. OCD? Maybe. certainly accused
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, talk still
minutes. point many children transiently express ticks low level
Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol
explored bunch different contexts, including ticks OCD, et cetera.
Going back inositol current use, say current use,
taking 900 milligrams inositol addition existing toolkit sleep,
talked many times podcast podcasts, consists magnesium


threonate, apigenin, theanine. want know kit, can go
newsletter, Neural Network Newsletter hubermanlab.com. toolkit sleep
there. don't even sign newsletter it'll give flavor
sorts things newsletter. case, experimenting bit
taking 900 milligrams myo-inositol either alone combination sleep kit.
must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem
lead enhanced levels focus alertness day. perhaps
noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects
experiments actually stop taking inositol gastric discomfort gastric
distress called. reported results sleep kind anecdotal way.
certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating
supplement protocol. think great future nutraceuticals, meaning
think systematic exploration particular lower dosages context OCD
treatment. saw SSRIs prescription drug treatments,
think really needs exploration nutraceuticals combination
behavioral therapies.

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often

Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking

sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will

many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't

around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding

interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,

now, imagine enormous number additional

SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side

depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting

OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid

OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people

many symptoms OCD show right around time puberty. haven't
talked lot childhood OCD, 'cause going entire series childhood
psychiatric disorders challenges many children develop OCD early young
three four, believe not, even 6 7 10 adolescence, certainly
around puberty. young adulthood. rare, although happen, people
will develop OCD late life around 40 older, just kind spontaneously.
often look clinical history, find either hiding
suppressed way, spontaneously show late life like mid-
thirties one's forties, typically traumatic brain injury, due stroke
physical injury head something sort. Nonetheless,
interesting correlation onset puberty certain forms OCD.
certain forms of, say, certain aspects menopause can relate
OCD. can find things literature. say hormones impact
neurotransmitters neuromodulators, clearly impact kinds circuits
involved OCD makes sense that, hope
exploration hormones impact OCD not distant future. Now
extensive literature exploring testosterone therapy, males females,
can effective cases treatment anxiety-related disorders, not,
least knowledge, OCD particular. whole area use
testosterone estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression, maybe even
enhancement treatment OCD

02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD

essentially big black box soon, believe, will lit. realize number
listeners podcast probably interested non-typical holistic
treatments OCD. Dr. Blair Simpson's lab least one study exploring role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. There, data little bit
complicated mention good things happening, least United
States, probably elsewhere well, good things happening terms
exploration things like meditation other, call non-traditional holistic
forms treatment psychiatric disorders division complimentary
health now launched National Institutes Health. So, whereas
people think meditation yoga nidra, even CBD supplementation


matter, kind fringe maybe, kind woo non-traditional least,
National Institutes Health United States now devoted entire division,
entire Institute, purely exploration things like breathing practices, meditation,
et cetera. cancer institute, hearing deafness institute,
vision institute, now complimentary health Institute, think
wonderful addition traditional aspects medicine. think no possible useful
treatment overlooked unresearched opinion, provided can
done safely. mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab looked role
mindfulness meditation treatment OCD. Now keep mind, no
pun intended, data mindfulness meditation shows increases
ability focus. Now, brings us back kind repeating theme today,
increased focus may not best thing somebody OCD might
increase focus obsession and/or compulsion. Turns mindfulness
meditation can useful treatment OCD, mainly way impacts
focus ability engage cognitive behavioral therapies.
unlikely, least read data, direct effect meditation relieving
symptoms, rather seems meditation increasing focus things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine

not focus things therefore indirectly improving symptoms
OCD. Now somewhat surprisingly, least me, also fairly large
number studies exploring nutraceuticals, sometimes called,
supplements available counter can impact treatment obsessive-
compulsive disorder. Now extensive number different compounds
supplements fall category nutraceuticals explored
treatment OCD like point review entitled,
Nutraceuticals treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder: review, excuse me,
mechanistic clinical evidence. published 2011, 10-years-old.
now, imagine enormous number additional
substances explored, just one two want focus
on. review, describe effects 5-HTP tryptophan, things
serotonin pathway, make sense given know


SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just
confess, first all, don't OCD, although will also confess
child, transient tick. talked podcast before. grunting
tick. six seven, recall trip Washington DC family,
feeling strong desire need even recall, grunt order clear
something throat, didn't anything throat. didn't cold
postnasal drip, really just feeling needed that, release sort
tension. remember dad time telling don't that. Don't that,
not good grunt something like that. think saw kind compulsive
behavior. actually hide back seat rental car it,
hide room. Fortunately me, transient, think six months year
later, disappeared. Although notice, actually ex-girlfriend mine point
get tired working long hours, sometimes grunting tick
will reappear. mean? Tourette's? don't know, maybe.
never diagnosed Tourette's. OCD? Maybe. certainly accused
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, talk still
minutes. point many children transiently express ticks low level
Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol
explored bunch different contexts, including ticks OCD, et cetera.
Going back inositol current use, say current use,
taking 900 milligrams inositol addition existing toolkit sleep,
talked many times podcast podcasts, consists magnesium


threonate, apigenin, theanine. want know kit, can go
newsletter, Neural Network Newsletter hubermanlab.com. toolkit sleep
there. don't even sign newsletter it'll give flavor
sorts things newsletter. case, experimenting bit
taking 900 milligrams myo-inositol either alone combination sleep kit.
must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem
lead enhanced levels focus alertness day. perhaps
noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects
experiments actually stop taking inositol gastric discomfort gastric
distress called. reported results sleep kind anecdotal way.
certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating
supplement protocol. think great future nutraceuticals, meaning
think systematic exploration particular lower dosages context OCD
treatment. saw SSRIs prescription drug treatments,
think really needs exploration nutraceuticals combination
behavioral therapies.

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people

to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely
debilitating condition one hope have, know people
gain sympathy understanding dealing
with, perhaps consequence information presented today, maybe

SSRIs people explore different supplements increase serotonergic
transmission might impact OCD. find significant effects
improving reducing symptoms OCD somewhat similar way
SSRIs. course careful. Anything going tap given
neurochemical system degree may likely sorts side
effects prescription drug would. One compound like focus little
depth, however, exciting interesting inositol. Inositol
compound going talk several future podcasts, because, well, first
all, seems can impressive effects reducing anxiety. also can
pretty impressive effects improving fertility particular women polycystic
ovarian syndrome. referring specifically myo-inositol comes
several forms. appear 900 milligrams inositol can improve sleep
can reduce anxiety perhaps taken dosage higher dosages. will just
confess, first all, don't OCD, although will also confess
child, transient tick. talked podcast before. grunting
tick. six seven, recall trip Washington DC family,
feeling strong desire need even recall, grunt order clear
something throat, didn't anything throat. didn't cold
postnasal drip, really just feeling needed that, release sort
tension. remember dad time telling don't that. Don't that,
not good grunt something like that. think saw kind compulsive

later, disappeared. Although notice, actually ex-girlfriend mine point
get tired working long hours, sometimes grunting tick
will reappear. mean? Tourette's? don't know, maybe.
never diagnosed Tourette's. OCD? Maybe. certainly accused
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, talk still
minutes. point many children transiently express ticks low level
Tourette's OCD, again, transiently disappears time. inositol
explored bunch different contexts, including ticks OCD, et cetera.
Going back inositol current use, say current use,

must say sleep getting inositol extremely deep seem

noticing 'cause talking quickly podcast previous podcast.
No, just kidding. don't think two things relate kind causal way.
point inositol known pretty effective reducing anxiety,
taken high dosages. Can low dosages? don't know.
consider 900 milligrams low dose. this, given fact studies
inositol explored high dosages, like even 10 12 grams per day,
must say seems exceedingly high report subjects
experiments actually stop taking inositol gastric discomfort gastric
distress called. reported results sleep kind anecdotal way.
certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies described experience
anecdotal way. nonetheless, explored things like glycine,
another, amino acid, also acts inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain, taken high dosages, 60 grams per day, absolutely astonishingly
high amount glycine. not recommend taking much glycine unless
part study tell know safe. 18 grams, excuse me,
inositol, very, high dosages used studies. Nonetheless,
interesting data inositol leading alleviation OCD symptoms
partial alleviation OCD symptoms little two weeks initiating

02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder

knows, maybe brain machine interface like cranial magnetic stimulation


well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget
move on. one key distinctions obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder strictest form. Now,
one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-

OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality

took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access

find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow

one hears OCD different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
difference intrusive thoughts not, useful, really
doesn't tell us anything happening mechanistically one situation
another. Fortunately, beautiful data Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
can tell based number studies referred laboratory,
truly one luminaries field, really fundamental
wiring differences behavioral differences psychological differences
people obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled,
Capacity delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder. methods study take 25 people
OCD 25 people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 25 people
both, possible important point out,
25 so-called healthy controls, people don't obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder. take clinical assessments
took number tests probed ability defer gratification, something
called, laboratory, call delayed discounting. ability defer
gratification task can either accept reward right away accept
reward later. may heard two marshmallow task. based
study performed years ago young children Stanford elsewhere
take young children room, offer marshmallow, kids like
marshmallows generally, say, can eat marshmallow right now
can wait period time, able wait not eat marshmallow,
can two marshmallows. general, children want two marshmallows
want one marshmallow. really probing ability access
delayed gratification. entertaining, even truly amusing videos
internet. just two marshmallow task video go YouTube,
find children will use sorts strategies delay gratification.
kids will cover marshmallow. Others will talk marshmallow
say, know not delicious. look delicious, no, not delicious.
engage marshmallow sorts cute ways. turn around try


to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,

02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions



can maladaptive, again, going depend context.
conclude, want touch something think lot people experience
superstitions. Superstitions fascinating, fascinating research
superstitions. One particular study big fan work Bence Olveczky
Harvard. studies motor sequences motor learning, beautiful data
people learn, instance, tennis swing patterns engage
early patterns swinging they, swinging racket is,
engage later acquire skill. basically takeaway amount
error variation swing swing dramatically reduced acquire skill.
fine good, beautiful mechanistic data others
discovered support comes be, also explore animal models,
particular, rats pressing sequences buttons levers obtain reward. Believe
not, rats pretty smart. seen eyes. can teach rat
press lever pellet food. Rats can also learn press levers particular
sequence order gain piece food. can actually learn press
enormous number levers particular sequences order obtain pellets
food. can also give little buttons press even paddle to, say
pedal, excuse me, stomp foot order obtain pellet food. Basically
rats can learn exactly need order obtain piece food, especially
made little bit hungry first. Bence's lab published beautiful data showing
animals humans come learn particular motor sequence, often
will introduce motor patterns sequence irrelevant outcome yet
persist. ever watched game baseball, seen before.
Oftentimes pitcher mound will bring ball chin. look
shoulder, look back shoulder, will, course,
reel back pitch ball. watch closely, oftentimes components
motor sequence, completely unrelated pitch. not looking
necessarily see someone's stealing base. not necessarily looking
home plate batter is. also things like touching back
ear bring ball chin adjusting hat. watch
individual pictures, find sequence completely
irrelevant motor patterns every single pitch. Similarly, rats
trained to, instance, hit two levers step pedal left hind foot,
tap button red button, will gain piece food.


sometimes also introduce pattern motor sequence will
shake tail little bit, turn head little bit, move ears
little bit, et cetera. Motor patterns nothing obtaining particular
outcome mind. words, eliminate certain components motor
sequence not matter, rat still get pellet, pitcher still
able pitch, yet get introduced somehow
performed prior successful trials, rat human baseball
pitcher comes believe way involved generating outcome,
hence superstition, right? confess superstitions. occasionally will knock
wood. say something want happen, say, oh, knock wood,
just it. occasionally challenge think, ah, don't want knock, don't
knock wood, Andrew, don't that. don't think anyone wants superstitious,
certainly don't. every while, just challenge it, won't actually
knock wood. admitting kind guess normalize this.
people superstitions border even become compulsions. really
come believe don't knock wood, something terrible going
happen, maybe something particular. case baseball pitcher, come
believe don't touch right ear reel back pitch,
pitch won't good going lose game. Well, don't know
thought process is. Now, also don't know rat thinking, rat
clearly something thinking something related final outcome. don't
know studies intervened particular superstition-like
behaviors rat see whether not rat somehow doesn't continue
motor sequence get pellet. don't know rats, rats. don't speak rat,
people don't, speak rat, speaks back, not English. Anyway,
point superstitions beliefs we, individual scale, come believe
linked probability outcome fact know, actually know
rational minds, no real relationship outcome. Superstitions can become
full-blown compulsions obsessions repeat often enough
become automatic. think observe time see
pitcher touching ear, instance, tennis, see lot, see
someone slap shoes. Often, see this, like slap undersides
soles. may tell is, don't know, maybe moving
dust something bottoms soles, gives traction


want ready serve something like that. maybe truth
that, here, referring behaviors really no rational
relationship outcome, yet perform compulsive way. People OCD,
yes, tend superstitions. People superstitions, yes, tend
tendency towards OCD mention, obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder. think way back first part episode, just describing
brain does, right? brain do? Housekeeping functions keep
alive prediction machine. neural circuits, you, enormous
amount biological investment real estate, literally, cells chemicals
try make world predictable try give control, least
sense control world normal process. Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions represent kind healthy range, say, behaviors
aimed generating predictability don't disrupt normal function. Obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, provided not severe, think represent
next level along continuum. obsessive-compulsive disorder, pointed
earlier, really case highly debilitating, highly intrusive, really overtake neural
circuitry thoughts behaviors requires dedicated, persistent,
effective treatments order stop obsessions compulsions
anxiety links somewhat counterintuitively teaching people tolerate
level increased anxiety interrupt patterns. fortunately, described
earlier, treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
also drug treatments tap glutamate system perhaps also
dopamine system, so-called neuroleptics. then, described, now
extensive exploration things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis, initial studies
don't seem hold much promise cannabis CBD treatment OCD,
knows, maybe studies will come along will change story.
course, brain machine interface like transcranial magnetic stimulation. just
remind already told combinations behavioral drug
treatments brain machine interface, think, really future lies.
Fortunately, good treatments exist. cannot say one individual treatment
works everybody. fairly large percentages people won't respond
one set treatments another, therefore one try different ones.
so-called supplementation-based holistic therapies. Today,
tried cover fairly substantial amount detail. realize


fairly long episode, intentional. Much like episode ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, received enormous number requests talk
OCD, decision make long detailed episode OCD really
doesn't stem desire subject much information avoid
opportunity just list things off, tried provide opportunity really
drill deep neural circuitry understanding OCD comes from,
OCD different things like personality disorders described. also
give sense individual behavioral drug treatments work perhaps
don't work can really make best informed choices, again, highlighting
fact OCD extremely common, extremely common, yet extremely

well. Now way back beginning episode, alluded fact OCD one
thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, truly disorder truly debilitating
extremely common, thing called obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, distinct not intrusive
component people don't feel overwhelmed overtaken thoughts, rather,
find obsessions can sometimes serve even welcome them.
think many us know people like this, perhaps even accused
knows, maybe accused obsessive-compulsive personality
times. draw distinction? Well, first all, come point human
history, think large part social media also large part
number discussions held mental health brought terms like
trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, common vernacular people will say,
ah, OCD, someone will say traumatized that, traumatized
this. careful, right? certainly not word police,
careful use certain types language, especially language real
psychiatric psychological definitions can really draw us off course
providing relief syndromes. instance, word trauma thrown
around left right nowadays. traumatized this, caused trauma,
giving trauma. Listen, realize many people traumatized certain events
including things said them, absolutely acknowledge that, hence episodes
trauma trauma treatment, several them, fact. Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
dedicated solo episodes just blabbing trauma trauma
treatment. Dr. Conti appropriately pointed out, trauma really something
changes neural circuitry therefore thoughts behaviors
persistent way detrimental us. Not every bad event traumatizing, not
everything dislike even hate feels terrible us traumatizing.
something reach level trauma, really needs change neural circuitry
therefore thoughts behaviors persistent way maladaptive
us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive one thing, saying someone
OCD assuming one OCD simply personality phenotype,
say, need things perfect order, like find correcting
pens making sure caps facing direction instance right now,
not OCD. If, instance, can tolerate pens different
orientation even throw cap floor something, doesn't create lot


anxiety me. confess, agree little bit moment, can forget

to, know, avoidance, actually speaks whole category behaviors
people OCD also use. not saying kids OCD, avoidance behaviors
much component OCD. People really trying avoid thing evokes
obsession. Well kids able delay gratification, aren't
debatable whether not kids able delay gratification go
successful lives not. Initially, conclusion studies.
still lot debate it, bring expert give us final conclusion
'cause one interesting not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults
also faced decisions every day, day whether not can delay
gratification. study used a, not two marshmallow task, game
involved rewards people delay order get greater rewards later.
conclusion? Well, first all, obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects showed impairments psychosocial functioning
quality life. compulsive behavior. people suffering
life compulsions really strong. not just really nit-
picky really orderly one case full blown OCD other, sets
subjects challenged life relationship issues job-related
issues, et cetera, compulsive. However, individuals
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, discounted value delayed
gratification significantly less obsessive-compulsive disorder.
mean? impairing disorders marked compulsive behaviors,
paraphrasing, can differentiated presence obsessions
OCD. obsessions OCD. People OCD absolutely fixated certain ideas
ideas intrusive. Again, hallmark theme. excessive
capacity delay reward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. people
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder really good delaying
gratification. able concentrate intensely perform intensely
ways allow instill order can delay reward. Now can see
contour symptoms, meaning people OCD experiencing
intrusive thoughts, whereas people obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
show enhanced ability defer gratification. see lead
different outcomes. People obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can
actually leverage personality disorder perform better certain domains life, not
domains life, remember, again, people study


showing experiencing challenges life obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Nonetheless, people obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, imagine, good say architecture anything
involves instilling ton order. Maybe sushi chef, instance, maybe chef general.
know chefs just kind throw things around like chef Muppets just
like throw things everywhere still produce amazing food.
people incredibly exacting, just incredibly precise. think movie,
it? Jiro Dreams Sushi? movie incredible. Certainly not saying
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, think fair say obsessive
extremely meticulous orderly everything start finish. can
imagine huge array different occupations life endeavors
beneficial, science one data collection analysis exceedingly
important one precise, mathematics physics engineering, anything
precision payoff gaining precision takes time delay immediate
gratification, can imagine obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
synergize well sorts activities professions. Whereas obsessive-
compulsive disorder really intrusive. preventing functionality many different
domains life. key takeaway use words obsessive-
compulsive, call someone obsessive-compulsive, trying evaluate
whether not obsessive compulsive, important highlight
obsessive compulsive disorder intrusive. involves intrusive thoughts
interrupts normal functioning life. Whereas obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, can interrupt normal functioning life, also can productive. can
enhance functioning life, not just work, perhaps home well.
somebody family members really place enormous value
beautiful highly organized home, well, lend well that. going
matter degrees, course. None things absolute, going
continuum, think fair say obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether
not mild, moderate, severe form impairing normal functioning, whereas
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, range expressions that,
can adaptive,
