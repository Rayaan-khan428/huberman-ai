gosh, need face things

00:14:05 Guilt & Shame, Origins Negative Emotions

going inside me. - psychoanalytic psychological, maybe even
neuroscience perspective, two questions. think experience
trauma, things call guilt shame surface? Everything telling
end, not adaptive. - Hmm. - [Paul] built way? -
Right, right. - first question. second question is,
conceptualize guilt shame? think hear guilt. hear shame.
think it? mean, emotions must exist us reason,


case, seems like they, don't serve us well. maybe order
reverse order, guilt, really? shame really? seem
reflexively wired feel guilty feel ashamed exact opposite
need case trauma? - Right, right. No, think great
questions. don't think anyone knows answers sure. read
something adaptive happened us evolution
now becomes maladaptive way live modern world, right? think
human development, people weren't living long, right?
idea survive reproduce. So, traumatic things happened us,
make sense stay us, right? ate new food got really, really
sick, better remember that, right? see someone group people,
couple miles away, right? one people attacks you, right? like, better
remember that. So, traumatic things sort emblazoned brain built
last, right? Things positive will generate emotion inside us, things
profoundly negative much likely stay us. think
adaptive, right? survival, right? think
thing true say shame, right? think here, makes sense talk little bit
actually interested thoughts this, right? limbic system, right?
system often called emotion system, right? brains actually course

So, aroused affect us also survival deep impact upon us
shame aroused affect. can raised us without choice

sense. doesn't make sense world live much longer, right?
navigate sorts different ways. much coming us can
traumatizing. mean, think news, right? mean, many times
written prescription someone says no news, right? - actually
written prescriptions? - Oh, yes, yes. glance news, look news
news, anything going need know, right? people looking
clicking clicking. sense like enthralled
frightening way horrors front us. shows yes,
trauma can come acute things happen us. Trauma can come
chronic things, chronic denigration, whether based upon socioeconomic status,
immigration status, race, religion, sexuality, gender identity, chronic traumas,
right? denigrated society around us, treated less can change
brain. vicarious experiences can too, right? know not theoretical.
know changes brain can come vicarious experiences too,
people glued news feeling like, oh goodness, like
happening? mothers Ukraine who've lost babies war. like,
things terrifying spend much time that,
similar effect. brains built change trauma, not way
experience trauma not way live life terms nature living life
duration life modern world, traumas happen us
often bad us change brain functioning.
entire orientation world different for, years years
decades decades. brings much misery suffering times brings
death. think hundred thousand overdose deaths country year,
100,000, mean a, much arising person treated
addiction intensively many years. think that, well, feel sure majority
addiction see treat arises, ultimately roots trauma


trying soothe something stuck inside person isn't letting outside
guilt shame, running around head tormented it.
now pool for, drugs sometimes medicines soothe. So,
opiates given minor surgery, right? like, okay, yeah, help
pain minor surgery, really helping pain inside, right?
quickly turns addiction, danger, risk. see
not theoretical way. Like see people practice
addiction, arising trauma subsequently died.

00:28:23 Deal Trauma & Negative Emotions/Arousal

sort of, writ large existence, modern world. - Incredible
way works. mean idea heard before. think
Freudian concept repetition compulsion. - Yes. - boggles
mind, hearing this, something happens us observe something traumatic.
instead acknowledging trying distance it, seems
reflex shame guilt many cases stuffing away repetition
behaviors continue try just stuff away. - [Paul] Yes. - Like trying
pack, don't know, recently packing home trying get sleeping bag back
bag. seems like always trying mushroom top, kind thing.
takes lot ongoing effort. time thing really exists,
repetition compulsion, people will return kinds scenarios
least kinds emotional states look just like trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
resemble way. question is, repetition compulsion
real thing? wired way? understanding concept
repetition compulsion want solve traumas. - [Paul] Yes. -
allows us put micro again, macro versions
again. get run experiment again. - Right. - attempt solve it. -
Right. - case taking drug clear certain drugs like opioids, clear
not allow us, deal it, right? - [Paul] Yeah. - just masking
emotional state. instance somebody experiences sexual
trauma, places circumstances sexual trauma?
somebody abusive relationship goes second third
fourth verbally, physically abusive relationship? Yeah, mean, face it,


just go, makes no sense. yet see again. - Yes,
first thing say validity repetition compulsion concept, right?
strong yes. Like, yes, see over. not necessarily everyone,
boy, lot people suffered trauma. think good
reason face, surface it, like, makes no sense. think,
well, brain, brains actually function, right? sort
trained least Western society, think, think logical creatures,
right? like, oh, logical. ultimately everything us can just boil
logic. think enough, going understand make right
decisions, completely not true, right? limbic system, right? emotion
system speak inside us always Trump's logic, right? think about,
ever make sense run burning building? mean, logic says no, right?
someone love burning building, people run right in, right?
limbic system says, yes. logic emotion come head head, emotion wins
time. emotion powerful enough, will always win. limbic system
important limbic system not care clock calendar, right?
answer. also, say repetition compulsion. limbic
system doesn't know like, oh, now, today. may, 2022. just doesn't care
all, right? relate repetition compulsion people
repeating, trying make things right, right? idea
can repeat situation make right, will fix everything, right? makes
perfect sense think, well, concept coming from, right? coming
emotional part brain wants relief suffering trauma not
understand clock calendar. can solve something now, will also solve
something past, right? can't tell many times sat
someone say, starting therapy, right? person will say, oh gosh,
like know, look, just can't help me, right? mean, know, last seven
relationships abusive, right? say back something sometimes like, well,
tell seven relationships abusive different
ways, agree you. Like, say that, 'cause never someone says,
right? think going tell kind relationship
seven times. not seven things, one, right? always, don't think one time
yet failed case. how, think it,
start elucidate going on. make light bulb goes off. Like


not seven different abusive relationships. one repeated seven
times now start getting really going needs happen,
person needs face happened original abusive relationship always
comes sort concepts, person feeling terrified abuse
going on, feeling guilty, feeling ashamed, feeling like, oh, brought
themselves. deserve it. don't deserve anything better, right?
brain trying make sense it, right? thought make okay,
couldn't, right? guilt shame. stuck inside
someone, like bundled inside someone, like medical abscess inside
person, walled off infection inside body, concept brain,
course limb system going want fix that. fixes trying
recreate situation make right time that's, mean, think one
best examples right approach like, look that, talk
that, right? really going there, wait, feel guilty ashamed
person abused person abusing, right? can get
going inside person. changes that. eighth
relationship can entirely different first seven, right? see
time. mean, isn't esoteric soft. Like see play clinically
again. things get better? go trauma unlock it.

00:37:17 Processing Trauma, Always Need Therapist?

not hidden inside can control things, right? bring surface
can take away power. - keep hearing narrative much reflexive
response trauma, emotional repetition compulsion terms
behaviors deep attempt change past. - Yes. - fact,
offline conversation, recall saying something this, that, number
behaviors thoughts avoidance behaviors avoidance thoughts
human beings put trying change past. - [Paul] Right. - remarkable
eerie maladaptive, sounds like. - [Paul] Yes. - really stuck
think want feel like control future feel
moment. extent, works brief while. thing
happened just, evokes internal arousal know
arousal. think many people, including myself,


fundamental question. Okay, thought thing, event events, plural,
evokes arousal, internal states, makes people feel sleepy exhausted.
people feel really anxious. people feel angry. mean arousal
different dimensions know, question like
it. - [Paul] Yes. love hear maybe even just top contour prescriptive
I, one do? even just put it, do? feeling
upset something. feel like options healthy catharsis. tell
story, feel it. could. can pack down. hear bad pack down.
course one functional life deal things. responsibilities
work relational responsibilities, etcetera. need sleep night. catharsis,
healthy catharsis, packing extreme. Telling story. yet think
lot people afraid tell story telling perhaps
reemergence arousal. - Yes. - arousal can become greater, mean. - Yes. -
people mean say things going get worse get
better? mean, guess, simple version long-winded question is, clear
need confront things. can't change past by, reflexive response isn't
going efficiently. deal arousal? one take
feel inside something shameful? moment?
done presence skilled trained therapist
driving work morning something comes up, can't deal right now
comes mind, do? deal right then? know big
multidimensional question. - Yes. - think one lot people grapple
with. want deal things. deal internal arousal? - Yeah,
yeah. often try change trauma past order control future
really adds trauma past dominates present, right?
doesn't way. remember, talking traumas rise
level changing brain. saying, involves re-experience,
involves hyper vigilance, increased arousal. changes mood states, changes
anxiety, changes sleep, changes behavior. changes
sense, push towards dominating present, right? not really living
present, right. trying control future. not going great job
controlling future not really living present, right? way
come moment, saying, okay, moment, need fall
asleep, right? might say, okay, let try put mind. Let try


thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo

might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming

clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.

like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,

glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

discussion Dr. Paul Conti. Paul, thank much today. - Thank
much me. - looking forward received ton
questions trauma, therapy, assess one
arc problems addressing familial issues relationship issues forth.
just start off basic just get everyone oriented. - Sure. -
define trauma? hard experiences. them, might ruminate
others, trauma? - make definition relevant, think
look trauma not anything negative happens us, right? something
overwhelms coping skills, leaves us different move forward.
changes way brains function, right? changes evident us
move forward life. - know trauma not? heard
everyone trauma. instance, heard child
child request love parent attention parent, dismiss
us microtrauma, overstating unfair real issue trauma?
trauma? micro traumas? macro traumas? - Right, think
traumas might categorize disappointments, right? things
negative, not deeply impactful, think not helpful definition, right? think
helpful definition something rises magnitude really changing us
something can see behave. can see mood, anxiety,


behavior, sleep, physical health. can identify can also see brain
changes. fact become, say hypervigilant, right? vigilant,
can see different parts brain active. definition,
definition captures trauma, rises certain level, like say,
trauma makes post trauma syndrome, right? Leaves us different, think
helpful definition trauma clinical definition, right? changes us
people can map changes identifiable shifts brain function. -
know changed something? mean, can think back
childhood events kid playground classroom said something,
didn't like, something negative me. think people can that.
great memory kid said something awful, parent teacher said
something awful really felt like hurt us least stuck us. clearly one's
brain, brain example changed event remember it,
know something actually changed way are?
course don't know otherwise. - Right, right. - difficult, right.
doable, difficult response, trauma rises level
changing brains don't just mean, like new memory, right? can
memories something negative, right? sense, changes
brain now something can call mind, doesn't change
functioning brain, right? trauma rises level changing functioning
brains, almost always reflex guilt shame around trauma
can lead us often leads us bury, right, avoid it, right? feel now
something negative inside feels shameful feels like no one else
accept it, right? So, happens people tend avoid looking change them,
exactly opposite needs done, right? idea viral
pandemic, right? want stay away one another isolate, right?
trauma epidemic need, need communicate people. need
communicate put words going inside us. often a, person
knows, mean, done much clinical work 20 years, focused
trauma. lot times person knows, right? not admitting
afraid it, right? don't know do,
start talking, talk event situation. something
acute, something chronic, really harmful them, right?
feel different afterwards. Like, oh, that, started thinking differently,


feeling differently, doesn't always happen. Sometimes process
exploration dialogue, right? Whether written whether spoken
person, exploring changes inside themselves, maybe changes self-
talk inside, changes thoughts world whether can navigate
safely readily it. know, anchors talk this, example use
times example life, where, know, much younger
early twenties, younger brother took life suicide. response guilt
shame hiding inside was, dramatic, wasn't
acknowledging it, right? 'Cause didn't know it. felt guilty
felt responsible felt ashamed. avoidance inside me.
wasn't saying myself, hey, this, like thought effective
make way world. know, good person
worked hard, make difference, right? afterwards, thought,
can't get anywhere. world's me. felt like, oh my, options
gone. know, like 24 years old, right? So, didn't see change
me, taking care poorly. Like enough going
unhealthy couldn't avoid realization like, hey, different now
ways automatic. reflex to, can make way world? Can
good life? Can happy? reflex different. coming
lens heightened anxiety, heightened vigilance, sense guilt, sense
shame sense non belonging world ultimately good helpful
people around realization. hey, things not going well, right?
led get help able talk realize like, oh
gosh, need face things

00:14:05 Guilt & Shame, Origins Negative Emotions

going inside me. - psychoanalytic psychological, maybe even
neuroscience perspective, two questions. think experience
trauma, things call guilt shame surface? Everything telling
end, not adaptive. - Hmm. - [Paul] built way? -
Right, right. - first question. second question is,
conceptualize guilt shame? think hear guilt. hear shame.
think it? mean, emotions must exist us reason,


case, seems like they, don't serve us well. maybe order
reverse order, guilt, really? shame really? seem
reflexively wired feel guilty feel ashamed exact opposite
need case trauma? - Right, right. No, think great
questions. don't think anyone knows answers sure. read
something adaptive happened us evolution
now becomes maladaptive way live modern world, right? think
human development, people weren't living long, right?
idea survive reproduce. So, traumatic things happened us,
make sense stay us, right? ate new food got really, really
sick, better remember that, right? see someone group people,
couple miles away, right? one people attacks you, right? like, better
remember that. So, traumatic things sort emblazoned brain built
last, right? Things positive will generate emotion inside us, things
profoundly negative much likely stay us. think
adaptive, right? survival, right? think
thing true say shame, right? think here, makes sense talk little bit
actually interested thoughts this, right? limbic system, right?
system often called emotion system, right? brains actually course

00:21:38 Repeating Trauma, Repetition Compulsion

varying function, right? one aspect affect, right? affect aroused us,
think meaning created us without choice, right? walking
road someone jumps front us pushes us, right?
response fear, anger, right? Heart starts beating faster, blood muscles,
getting ready fight, right? run, right? become aware it, right?
So, aroused affect us also survival deep impact upon us
shame aroused affect. can raised us without choice
powerful, think extremely strong deterrent, right?
had, know, imagine tribe group people, right? sheltered together,
and, know, someone eats half food night something, right? like
negative response, right? person feels shame shame
powerful control behavior, right? way trauma can change brains


stay us way says, vigilant, look world different way, act
defensively, right? links shame guilt, guilt in, guilt
becomes gets called feeling technically relate aroused affect
ourselves, right? So, shame aroused affect guilt, next step, right?
shame gets related self profound behavioral interventions deterrents,
right? can see, think evolutionarily kind makes sense
fighting survival elder statesman make 20, right? makes
sense. doesn't make sense world live much longer, right?
navigate sorts different ways. much coming us can
traumatizing. mean, think news, right? mean, many times
written prescription someone says no news, right? - actually
written prescriptions? - Oh, yes, yes. glance news, look news
news, anything going need know, right? people looking
clicking clicking. sense like enthralled
frightening way horrors front us. shows yes,
trauma can come acute things happen us. Trauma can come
chronic things, chronic denigration, whether based upon socioeconomic status,
immigration status, race, religion, sexuality, gender identity, chronic traumas,
right? denigrated society around us, treated less can change
brain. vicarious experiences can too, right? know not theoretical.
know changes brain can come vicarious experiences too,
people glued news feeling like, oh goodness, like
happening? mothers Ukraine who've lost babies war. like,
things terrifying spend much time that,
similar effect. brains built change trauma, not way
experience trauma not way live life terms nature living life
duration life modern world, traumas happen us
often bad us change brain functioning.
entire orientation world different for, years years
decades decades. brings much misery suffering times brings
death. think hundred thousand overdose deaths country year,
100,000, mean a, much arising person treated
addiction intensively many years. think that, well, feel sure majority
addiction see treat arises, ultimately roots trauma


trying soothe something stuck inside person isn't letting outside
guilt shame, running around head tormented it.
now pool for, drugs sometimes medicines soothe. So,
opiates given minor surgery, right? like, okay, yeah, help

brain trying make sense it, right? thought make okay,
couldn't, right? guilt shame. stuck inside
someone, like bundled inside someone, like medical abscess inside
person, walled off infection inside body, concept brain,
course limb system going want fix that. fixes trying

behaviors thoughts avoidance behaviors avoidance thoughts
human beings put trying change past. - [Paul] Right. - remarkable

lot people afraid tell story telling perhaps
reemergence arousal. - Yes. - arousal can become greater, mean. - Yes. -
people mean say things going get worse get
better? mean, guess, simple version long-winded question is, clear
need confront things. can't change past by, reflexive response isn't
going efficiently. deal arousal? one take
feel inside something shameful? moment?
done presence skilled trained therapist
driving work morning something comes up, can't deal right now
comes mind, do? deal right then? know big
multidimensional question. - Yes. - think one lot people grapple
with. want deal things. deal internal arousal? - Yeah,
yeah. often try change trauma past order control future
really adds trauma past dominates present, right?
doesn't way. remember, talking traumas rise
level changing brain. saying, involves re-experience,
involves hyper vigilance, increased arousal. changes mood states, changes
anxiety, changes sleep, changes behavior. changes
sense, push towards dominating present, right? not really living
present, right. trying control future. not going great job
controlling future not really living present, right? way
come moment, saying, okay, moment, need fall
asleep, right? might say, okay, let try put mind. Let try


thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank

00:14:05 Guilt & Shame, Origins Negative Emotions

going inside me. - psychoanalytic psychological, maybe even
neuroscience perspective, two questions. think experience
trauma, things call guilt shame surface? Everything telling
end, not adaptive. - Hmm. - [Paul] built way? -
Right, right. - first question. second question is,
conceptualize guilt shame? think hear guilt. hear shame.
think it? mean, emotions must exist us reason,


case, seems like they, don't serve us well. maybe order
reverse order, guilt, really? shame really? seem
reflexively wired feel guilty feel ashamed exact opposite
need case trauma? - Right, right. No, think great
questions. don't think anyone knows answers sure. read
something adaptive happened us evolution
now becomes maladaptive way live modern world, right? think
human development, people weren't living long, right?
idea survive reproduce. So, traumatic things happened us,
make sense stay us, right? ate new food got really, really
sick, better remember that, right? see someone group people,
couple miles away, right? one people attacks you, right? like, better
remember that. So, traumatic things sort emblazoned brain built
last, right? Things positive will generate emotion inside us, things
profoundly negative much likely stay us. think
adaptive, right? survival, right? think
thing true say shame, right? think here, makes sense talk little bit
actually interested thoughts this, right? limbic system, right?
system often called emotion system, right? brains actually course

00:21:38 Repeating Trauma, Repetition Compulsion

varying function, right? one aspect affect, right? affect aroused us,
think meaning created us without choice, right? walking
road someone jumps front us pushes us, right?
response fear, anger, right? Heart starts beating faster, blood muscles,
getting ready fight, right? run, right? become aware it, right?
So, aroused affect us also survival deep impact upon us
shame aroused affect. can raised us without choice
powerful, think extremely strong deterrent, right?
had, know, imagine tribe group people, right? sheltered together,
and, know, someone eats half food night something, right? like
negative response, right? person feels shame shame
powerful control behavior, right? way trauma can change brains


stay us way says, vigilant, look world different way, act
defensively, right? links shame guilt, guilt in, guilt
becomes gets called feeling technically relate aroused affect
ourselves, right? So, shame aroused affect guilt, next step, right?
shame gets related self profound behavioral interventions deterrents,
right? can see, think evolutionarily kind makes sense
fighting survival elder statesman make 20, right? makes
sense. doesn't make sense world live much longer, right?
navigate sorts different ways. much coming us can
traumatizing. mean, think news, right? mean, many times
written prescription someone says no news, right? - actually
written prescriptions? - Oh, yes, yes. glance news, look news
news, anything going need know, right? people looking
clicking clicking. sense like enthralled
frightening way horrors front us. shows yes,
trauma can come acute things happen us. Trauma can come
chronic things, chronic denigration, whether based upon socioeconomic status,
immigration status, race, religion, sexuality, gender identity, chronic traumas,
right? denigrated society around us, treated less can change
brain. vicarious experiences can too, right? know not theoretical.
know changes brain can come vicarious experiences too,
people glued news feeling like, oh goodness, like
happening? mothers Ukraine who've lost babies war. like,
things terrifying spend much time that,
similar effect. brains built change trauma, not way
experience trauma not way live life terms nature living life
duration life modern world, traumas happen us
often bad us change brain functioning.
entire orientation world different for, years years
decades decades. brings much misery suffering times brings
death. think hundred thousand overdose deaths country year,
100,000, mean a, much arising person treated
addiction intensively many years. think that, well, feel sure majority
addiction see treat arises, ultimately roots trauma


trying soothe something stuck inside person isn't letting outside
guilt shame, running around head tormented it.
now pool for, drugs sometimes medicines soothe. So,
opiates given minor surgery, right? like, okay, yeah, help
pain minor surgery, really helping pain inside, right?
quickly turns addiction, danger, risk. see
not theoretical way. Like see people practice
addiction, arising trauma subsequently died.

00:28:23 Deal Trauma & Negative Emotions/Arousal

sort of, writ large existence, modern world. - Incredible
way works. mean idea heard before. think
Freudian concept repetition compulsion. - Yes. - boggles
mind, hearing this, something happens us observe something traumatic.
instead acknowledging trying distance it, seems
reflex shame guilt many cases stuffing away repetition
behaviors continue try just stuff away. - [Paul] Yes. - Like trying
pack, don't know, recently packing home trying get sleeping bag back
bag. seems like always trying mushroom top, kind thing.
takes lot ongoing effort. time thing really exists,
repetition compulsion, people will return kinds scenarios
least kinds emotional states look just like trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
resemble way. question is, repetition compulsion
real thing? wired way? understanding concept
repetition compulsion want solve traumas. - [Paul] Yes. -
allows us put micro again, macro versions
again. get run experiment again. - Right. - attempt solve it. -
Right. - case taking drug clear certain drugs like opioids, clear
not allow us, deal it, right? - [Paul] Yeah. - just masking
emotional state. instance somebody experiences sexual
trauma, places circumstances sexual trauma?
somebody abusive relationship goes second third
fourth verbally, physically abusive relationship? Yeah, mean, face it,


just go, makes no sense. yet see again. - Yes,
first thing say validity repetition compulsion concept, right?
strong yes. Like, yes, see over. not necessarily everyone,
boy, lot people suffered trauma. think good
reason face, surface it, like, makes no sense. think,
well, brain, brains actually function, right? sort
trained least Western society, think, think logical creatures,
right? like, oh, logical. ultimately everything us can just boil
logic. think enough, going understand make right
decisions, completely not true, right? limbic system, right? emotion
system speak inside us always Trump's logic, right? think about,
ever make sense run burning building? mean, logic says no, right?
someone love burning building, people run right in, right?
limbic system says, yes. logic emotion come head head, emotion wins
time. emotion powerful enough, will always win. limbic system
important limbic system not care clock calendar, right?
answer. also, say repetition compulsion. limbic
system doesn't know like, oh, now, today. may, 2022. just doesn't care
all, right? relate repetition compulsion people
repeating, trying make things right, right? idea
can repeat situation make right, will fix everything, right? makes
perfect sense think, well, concept coming from, right? coming
emotional part brain wants relief suffering trauma not
understand clock calendar. can solve something now, will also solve
something past, right? can't tell many times sat
someone say, starting therapy, right? person will say, oh gosh,
like know, look, just can't help me, right? mean, know, last seven
relationships abusive, right? say back something sometimes like, well,
tell seven relationships abusive different
ways, agree you. Like, say that, 'cause never someone says,
right? think going tell kind relationship
seven times. not seven things, one, right? always, don't think one time
yet failed case. how, think it,
start elucidate going on. make light bulb goes off. Like


not seven different abusive relationships. one repeated seven
times now start getting really going needs happen,
person needs face happened original abusive relationship always
comes sort concepts, person feeling terrified abuse
going on, feeling guilty, feeling ashamed, feeling like, oh, brought
themselves. deserve it. don't deserve anything better, right?
brain trying make sense it, right? thought make okay,
couldn't, right? guilt shame. stuck inside
someone, like bundled inside someone, like medical abscess inside
person, walled off infection inside body, concept brain,
course limb system going want fix that. fixes trying
recreate situation make right time that's, mean, think one
best examples right approach like, look that, talk
that, right? really going there, wait, feel guilty ashamed
person abused person abusing, right? can get
going inside person. changes that. eighth
relationship can entirely different first seven, right? see
time. mean, isn't esoteric soft. Like see play clinically
again. things get better? go trauma unlock it.

00:37:17 Processing Trauma, Always Need Therapist?

not hidden inside can control things, right? bring surface
can take away power. - keep hearing narrative much reflexive
response trauma, emotional repetition compulsion terms
behaviors deep attempt change past. - Yes. - fact,
offline conversation, recall saying something this, that, number
behaviors thoughts avoidance behaviors avoidance thoughts
human beings put trying change past. - [Paul] Right. - remarkable
eerie maladaptive, sounds like. - [Paul] Yes. - really stuck
think want feel like control future feel
moment. extent, works brief while. thing
happened just, evokes internal arousal know
arousal. think many people, including myself,


fundamental question. Okay, thought thing, event events, plural,
evokes arousal, internal states, makes people feel sleepy exhausted.
people feel really anxious. people feel angry. mean arousal
different dimensions know, question like
it. - [Paul] Yes. love hear maybe even just top contour prescriptive
I, one do? even just put it, do? feeling
upset something. feel like options healthy catharsis. tell
story, feel it. could. can pack down. hear bad pack down.
course one functional life deal things. responsibilities
work relational responsibilities, etcetera. need sleep night. catharsis,
healthy catharsis, packing extreme. Telling story. yet think
lot people afraid tell story telling perhaps
reemergence arousal. - Yes. - arousal can become greater, mean. - Yes. -
people mean say things going get worse get
better? mean, guess, simple version long-winded question is, clear
need confront things. can't change past by, reflexive response isn't
going efficiently. deal arousal? one take
feel inside something shameful? moment?
done presence skilled trained therapist
driving work morning something comes up, can't deal right now
comes mind, do? deal right then? know big
multidimensional question. - Yes. - think one lot people grapple
with. want deal things. deal internal arousal? - Yeah,
yeah. often try change trauma past order control future
really adds trauma past dominates present, right?
doesn't way. remember, talking traumas rise
level changing brain. saying, involves re-experience,
involves hyper vigilance, increased arousal. changes mood states, changes
anxiety, changes sleep, changes behavior. changes
sense, push towards dominating present, right? not really living
present, right. trying control future. not going great job
controlling future not really living present, right? way
come moment, saying, okay, moment, need fall
asleep, right? might say, okay, let try put mind. Let try


thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

00:14:05 Guilt & Shame, Origins Negative Emotions

going inside me. - psychoanalytic psychological, maybe even
neuroscience perspective, two questions. think experience
trauma, things call guilt shame surface? Everything telling
end, not adaptive. - Hmm. - [Paul] built way? -
Right, right. - first question. second question is,
conceptualize guilt shame? think hear guilt. hear shame.
think it? mean, emotions must exist us reason,


case, seems like they, don't serve us well. maybe order
reverse order, guilt, really? shame really? seem
reflexively wired feel guilty feel ashamed exact opposite
need case trauma? - Right, right. No, think great
questions. don't think anyone knows answers sure. read
something adaptive happened us evolution
now becomes maladaptive way live modern world, right? think
human development, people weren't living long, right?
idea survive reproduce. So, traumatic things happened us,
make sense stay us, right? ate new food got really, really
sick, better remember that, right? see someone group people,
couple miles away, right? one people attacks you, right? like, better
remember that. So, traumatic things sort emblazoned brain built
last, right? Things positive will generate emotion inside us, things
profoundly negative much likely stay us. think
adaptive, right? survival, right? think
thing true say shame, right? think here, makes sense talk little bit

sense. doesn't make sense world live much longer, right?
navigate sorts different ways. much coming us can
traumatizing. mean, think news, right? mean, many times
written prescription someone says no news, right? - actually
written prescriptions? - Oh, yes, yes. glance news, look news
news, anything going need know, right? people looking
clicking clicking. sense like enthralled
frightening way horrors front us. shows yes,
trauma can come acute things happen us. Trauma can come
chronic things, chronic denigration, whether based upon socioeconomic status,
immigration status, race, religion, sexuality, gender identity, chronic traumas,
right? denigrated society around us, treated less can change
brain. vicarious experiences can too, right? know not theoretical.
know changes brain can come vicarious experiences too,
people glued news feeling like, oh goodness, like
happening? mothers Ukraine who've lost babies war. like,
things terrifying spend much time that,
similar effect. brains built change trauma, not way
experience trauma not way live life terms nature living life
duration life modern world, traumas happen us
often bad us change brain functioning.
entire orientation world different for, years years
decades decades. brings much misery suffering times brings
death. think hundred thousand overdose deaths country year,
100,000, mean a, much arising person treated
addiction intensively many years. think that, well, feel sure majority
addiction see treat arises, ultimately roots trauma


trying soothe something stuck inside person isn't letting outside
guilt shame, running around head tormented it.
now pool for, drugs sometimes medicines soothe. So,
opiates given minor surgery, right? like, okay, yeah, help
pain minor surgery, really helping pain inside, right?
quickly turns addiction, danger, risk. see
not theoretical way. Like see people practice
addiction, arising trauma subsequently died.

00:28:23 Deal Trauma & Negative Emotions/Arousal

sort of, writ large existence, modern world. - Incredible
way works. mean idea heard before. think
Freudian concept repetition compulsion. - Yes. - boggles
mind, hearing this, something happens us observe something traumatic.
instead acknowledging trying distance it, seems
reflex shame guilt many cases stuffing away repetition
behaviors continue try just stuff away. - [Paul] Yes. - Like trying
pack, don't know, recently packing home trying get sleeping bag back
bag. seems like always trying mushroom top, kind thing.
takes lot ongoing effort. time thing really exists,
repetition compulsion, people will return kinds scenarios
least kinds emotional states look just like trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
resemble way. question is, repetition compulsion
real thing? wired way? understanding concept
repetition compulsion want solve traumas. - [Paul] Yes. -
allows us put micro again, macro versions
again. get run experiment again. - Right. - attempt solve it. -
Right. - case taking drug clear certain drugs like opioids, clear
not allow us, deal it, right? - [Paul] Yeah. - just masking
emotional state. instance somebody experiences sexual
trauma, places circumstances sexual trauma?
somebody abusive relationship goes second third
fourth verbally, physically abusive relationship? Yeah, mean, face it,


just go, makes no sense. yet see again. - Yes,
first thing say validity repetition compulsion concept, right?
strong yes. Like, yes, see over. not necessarily everyone,
boy, lot people suffered trauma. think good
reason face, surface it, like, makes no sense. think,
well, brain, brains actually function, right? sort
trained least Western society, think, think logical creatures,
right? like, oh, logical. ultimately everything us can just boil
logic. think enough, going understand make right
decisions, completely not true, right? limbic system, right? emotion
system speak inside us always Trump's logic, right? think about,
ever make sense run burning building? mean, logic says no, right?
someone love burning building, people run right in, right?
limbic system says, yes. logic emotion come head head, emotion wins
time. emotion powerful enough, will always win. limbic system
important limbic system not care clock calendar, right?
answer. also, say repetition compulsion. limbic
system doesn't know like, oh, now, today. may, 2022. just doesn't care
all, right? relate repetition compulsion people
repeating, trying make things right, right? idea
can repeat situation make right, will fix everything, right? makes
perfect sense think, well, concept coming from, right? coming
emotional part brain wants relief suffering trauma not
understand clock calendar. can solve something now, will also solve
something past, right? can't tell many times sat
someone say, starting therapy, right? person will say, oh gosh,
like know, look, just can't help me, right? mean, know, last seven
relationships abusive, right? say back something sometimes like, well,
tell seven relationships abusive different
ways, agree you. Like, say that, 'cause never someone says,
right? think going tell kind relationship
seven times. not seven things, one, right? always, don't think one time
yet failed case. how, think it,
start elucidate going on. make light bulb goes off. Like


not seven different abusive relationships. one repeated seven
times now start getting really going needs happen,
person needs face happened original abusive relationship always
comes sort concepts, person feeling terrified abuse
going on, feeling guilty, feeling ashamed, feeling like, oh, brought
themselves. deserve it. don't deserve anything better, right?
brain trying make sense it, right? thought make okay,
couldn't, right? guilt shame. stuck inside
someone, like bundled inside someone, like medical abscess inside
person, walled off infection inside body, concept brain,
course limb system going want fix that. fixes trying
recreate situation make right time that's, mean, think one
best examples right approach like, look that, talk
that, right? really going there, wait, feel guilty ashamed
person abused person abusing, right? can get
going inside person. changes that. eighth
relationship can entirely different first seven, right? see
time. mean, isn't esoteric soft. Like see play clinically
again. things get better? go trauma unlock it.

00:37:17 Processing Trauma, Always Need Therapist?

not hidden inside can control things, right? bring surface
can take away power. - keep hearing narrative much reflexive
response trauma, emotional repetition compulsion terms
behaviors deep attempt change past. - Yes. - fact,
offline conversation, recall saying something this, that, number
behaviors thoughts avoidance behaviors avoidance thoughts
human beings put trying change past. - [Paul] Right. - remarkable
eerie maladaptive, sounds like. - [Paul] Yes. - really stuck
think want feel like control future feel
moment. extent, works brief while. thing
happened just, evokes internal arousal know
arousal. think many people, including myself,


fundamental question. Okay, thought thing, event events, plural,
evokes arousal, internal states, makes people feel sleepy exhausted.
people feel really anxious. people feel angry. mean arousal
different dimensions know, question like
it. - [Paul] Yes. love hear maybe even just top contour prescriptive
I, one do? even just put it, do? feeling
upset something. feel like options healthy catharsis. tell
story, feel it. could. can pack down. hear bad pack down.
course one functional life deal things. responsibilities
work relational responsibilities, etcetera. need sleep night. catharsis,
healthy catharsis, packing extreme. Telling story. yet think
lot people afraid tell story telling perhaps
reemergence arousal. - Yes. - arousal can become greater, mean. - Yes. -
people mean say things going get worse get
better? mean, guess, simple version long-winded question is, clear
need confront things. can't change past by, reflexive response isn't
going efficiently. deal arousal? one take
feel inside something shameful? moment?
done presence skilled trained therapist
driving work morning something comes up, can't deal right now
comes mind, do? deal right then? know big
multidimensional question. - Yes. - think one lot people grapple
with. want deal things. deal internal arousal? - Yeah,
yeah. often try change trauma past order control future
really adds trauma past dominates present, right?
doesn't way. remember, talking traumas rise
level changing brain. saying, involves re-experience,
involves hyper vigilance, increased arousal. changes mood states, changes
anxiety, changes sleep, changes behavior. changes
sense, push towards dominating present, right? not really living
present, right. trying control future. not going great job
controlling future not really living present, right? way
come moment, saying, okay, moment, need fall
asleep, right? might say, okay, let try put mind. Let try


thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.

going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going

feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.

lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone

sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro

think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,

attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.

psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,

case, seems like they, don't serve us well. maybe order
reverse order, guilt, really? shame really? seem
reflexively wired feel guilty feel ashamed exact opposite
need case trauma? - Right, right. No, think great
questions. don't think anyone knows answers sure. read
something adaptive happened us evolution
now becomes maladaptive way live modern world, right? think
human development, people weren't living long, right?
idea survive reproduce. So, traumatic things happened us,
make sense stay us, right? ate new food got really, really
sick, better remember that, right? see someone group people,
couple miles away, right? one people attacks you, right? like, better
remember that. So, traumatic things sort emblazoned brain built
last, right? Things positive will generate emotion inside us, things
profoundly negative much likely stay us. think
adaptive, right? survival, right? think
thing true say shame, right? think here, makes sense talk little bit
actually interested thoughts this, right? limbic system, right?
system often called emotion system, right? brains actually course

00:21:38 Repeating Trauma, Repetition Compulsion

varying function, right? one aspect affect, right? affect aroused us,
think meaning created us without choice, right? walking
road someone jumps front us pushes us, right?
response fear, anger, right? Heart starts beating faster, blood muscles,
getting ready fight, right? run, right? become aware it, right?
So, aroused affect us also survival deep impact upon us
shame aroused affect. can raised us without choice
powerful, think extremely strong deterrent, right?
had, know, imagine tribe group people, right? sheltered together,
and, know, someone eats half food night something, right? like
negative response, right? person feels shame shame
powerful control behavior, right? way trauma can change brains


stay us way says, vigilant, look world different way, act
defensively, right? links shame guilt, guilt in, guilt
becomes gets called feeling technically relate aroused affect
ourselves, right? So, shame aroused affect guilt, next step, right?
shame gets related self profound behavioral interventions deterrents,
right? can see, think evolutionarily kind makes sense
fighting survival elder statesman make 20, right? makes
sense. doesn't make sense world live much longer, right?
navigate sorts different ways. much coming us can
traumatizing. mean, think news, right? mean, many times
written prescription someone says no news, right? - actually
written prescriptions? - Oh, yes, yes. glance news, look news
news, anything going need know, right? people looking
clicking clicking. sense like enthralled
frightening way horrors front us. shows yes,
trauma can come acute things happen us. Trauma can come
chronic things, chronic denigration, whether based upon socioeconomic status,
immigration status, race, religion, sexuality, gender identity, chronic traumas,
right? denigrated society around us, treated less can change
brain. vicarious experiences can too, right? know not theoretical.
know changes brain can come vicarious experiences too,
people glued news feeling like, oh goodness, like
happening? mothers Ukraine who've lost babies war. like,
things terrifying spend much time that,
similar effect. brains built change trauma, not way
experience trauma not way live life terms nature living life
duration life modern world, traumas happen us
often bad us change brain functioning.
entire orientation world different for, years years
decades decades. brings much misery suffering times brings
death. think hundred thousand overdose deaths country year,
100,000, mean a, much arising person treated
addiction intensively many years. think that, well, feel sure majority
addiction see treat arises, ultimately roots trauma


trying soothe something stuck inside person isn't letting outside
guilt shame, running around head tormented it.
now pool for, drugs sometimes medicines soothe. So,
opiates given minor surgery, right? like, okay, yeah, help
pain minor surgery, really helping pain inside, right?
quickly turns addiction, danger, risk. see
not theoretical way. Like see people practice
addiction, arising trauma subsequently died.

00:28:23 Deal Trauma & Negative Emotions/Arousal

sort of, writ large existence, modern world. - Incredible
way works. mean idea heard before. think
Freudian concept repetition compulsion. - Yes. - boggles
mind, hearing this, something happens us observe something traumatic.
instead acknowledging trying distance it, seems
reflex shame guilt many cases stuffing away repetition
behaviors continue try just stuff away. - [Paul] Yes. - Like trying
pack, don't know, recently packing home trying get sleeping bag back
bag. seems like always trying mushroom top, kind thing.
takes lot ongoing effort. time thing really exists,
repetition compulsion, people will return kinds scenarios
least kinds emotional states look just like trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
resemble way. question is, repetition compulsion
real thing? wired way? understanding concept
repetition compulsion want solve traumas. - [Paul] Yes. -
allows us put micro again, macro versions
again. get run experiment again. - Right. - attempt solve it. -
Right. - case taking drug clear certain drugs like opioids, clear
not allow us, deal it, right? - [Paul] Yeah. - just masking
emotional state. instance somebody experiences sexual
trauma, places circumstances sexual trauma?
somebody abusive relationship goes second third
fourth verbally, physically abusive relationship? Yeah, mean, face it,


just go, makes no sense. yet see again. - Yes,
first thing say validity repetition compulsion concept, right?
strong yes. Like, yes, see over. not necessarily everyone,
boy, lot people suffered trauma. think good
reason face, surface it, like, makes no sense. think,
well, brain, brains actually function, right? sort
trained least Western society, think, think logical creatures,
right? like, oh, logical. ultimately everything us can just boil
logic. think enough, going understand make right
decisions, completely not true, right? limbic system, right? emotion
system speak inside us always Trump's logic, right? think about,
ever make sense run burning building? mean, logic says no, right?
someone love burning building, people run right in, right?
limbic system says, yes. logic emotion come head head, emotion wins
time. emotion powerful enough, will always win. limbic system
important limbic system not care clock calendar, right?
answer. also, say repetition compulsion. limbic
system doesn't know like, oh, now, today. may, 2022. just doesn't care
all, right? relate repetition compulsion people
repeating, trying make things right, right? idea
can repeat situation make right, will fix everything, right? makes
perfect sense think, well, concept coming from, right? coming
emotional part brain wants relief suffering trauma not
understand clock calendar. can solve something now, will also solve
something past, right? can't tell many times sat
someone say, starting therapy, right? person will say, oh gosh,
like know, look, just can't help me, right? mean, know, last seven
relationships abusive, right? say back something sometimes like, well,
tell seven relationships abusive different
ways, agree you. Like, say that, 'cause never someone says,
right? think going tell kind relationship
seven times. not seven things, one, right? always, don't think one time
yet failed case. how, think it,
start elucidate going on. make light bulb goes off. Like


not seven different abusive relationships. one repeated seven
times now start getting really going needs happen,
person needs face happened original abusive relationship always
comes sort concepts, person feeling terrified abuse
going on, feeling guilty, feeling ashamed, feeling like, oh, brought
themselves. deserve it. don't deserve anything better, right?
brain trying make sense it, right? thought make okay,
couldn't, right? guilt shame. stuck inside
someone, like bundled inside someone, like medical abscess inside
person, walled off infection inside body, concept brain,
course limb system going want fix that. fixes trying
recreate situation make right time that's, mean, think one
best examples right approach like, look that, talk
that, right? really going there, wait, feel guilty ashamed
person abused person abusing, right? can get
going inside person. changes that. eighth
relationship can entirely different first seven, right? see
time. mean, isn't esoteric soft. Like see play clinically
again. things get better? go trauma unlock it.

00:37:17 Processing Trauma, Always Need Therapist?

not hidden inside can control things, right? bring surface
can take away power. - keep hearing narrative much reflexive
response trauma, emotional repetition compulsion terms
behaviors deep attempt change past. - Yes. - fact,
offline conversation, recall saying something this, that, number
behaviors thoughts avoidance behaviors avoidance thoughts
human beings put trying change past. - [Paul] Right. - remarkable
eerie maladaptive, sounds like. - [Paul] Yes. - really stuck
think want feel like control future feel
moment. extent, works brief while. thing
happened just, evokes internal arousal know
arousal. think many people, including myself,


fundamental question. Okay, thought thing, event events, plural,
evokes arousal, internal states, makes people feel sleepy exhausted.
people feel really anxious. people feel angry. mean arousal
different dimensions know, question like
it. - [Paul] Yes. love hear maybe even just top contour prescriptive
I, one do? even just put it, do? feeling
upset something. feel like options healthy catharsis. tell
story, feel it. could. can pack down. hear bad pack down.
course one functional life deal things. responsibilities
work relational responsibilities, etcetera. need sleep night. catharsis,
healthy catharsis, packing extreme. Telling story. yet think
lot people afraid tell story telling perhaps
reemergence arousal. - Yes. - arousal can become greater, mean. - Yes. -
people mean say things going get worse get
better? mean, guess, simple version long-winded question is, clear
need confront things. can't change past by, reflexive response isn't
going efficiently. deal arousal? one take
feel inside something shameful? moment?
done presence skilled trained therapist
driving work morning something comes up, can't deal right now
comes mind, do? deal right then? know big
multidimensional question. - Yes. - think one lot people grapple
with. want deal things. deal internal arousal? - Yeah,
yeah. often try change trauma past order control future
really adds trauma past dominates present, right?
doesn't way. remember, talking traumas rise
level changing brain. saying, involves re-experience,
involves hyper vigilance, increased arousal. changes mood states, changes
anxiety, changes sleep, changes behavior. changes
sense, push towards dominating present, right? not really living
present, right. trying control future. not going great job
controlling future not really living present, right? way
come moment, saying, okay, moment, need fall
asleep, right? might say, okay, let try put mind. Let try


thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -
welcome. take heart appreciative

sort of, writ large existence, modern world. - Incredible
way works. mean idea heard before. think
Freudian concept repetition compulsion. - Yes. - boggles
mind, hearing this, something happens us observe something traumatic.
instead acknowledging trying distance it, seems
reflex shame guilt many cases stuffing away repetition
behaviors continue try just stuff away. - [Paul] Yes. - Like trying
pack, don't know, recently packing home trying get sleeping bag back
bag. seems like always trying mushroom top, kind thing.
takes lot ongoing effort. time thing really exists,
repetition compulsion, people will return kinds scenarios
least kinds emotional states look just like trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
resemble way. question is, repetition compulsion
real thing? wired way? understanding concept
repetition compulsion want solve traumas. - [Paul] Yes. -
allows us put micro again, macro versions
again. get run experiment again. - Right. - attempt solve it. -
Right. - case taking drug clear certain drugs like opioids, clear
not allow us, deal it, right? - [Paul] Yeah. - just masking
emotional state. instance somebody experiences sexual
trauma, places circumstances sexual trauma?
somebody abusive relationship goes second third
fourth verbally, physically abusive relationship? Yeah, mean, face it,


just go, makes no sense. yet see again. - Yes,
first thing say validity repetition compulsion concept, right?
strong yes. Like, yes, see over. not necessarily everyone,
boy, lot people suffered trauma. think good
reason face, surface it, like, makes no sense. think,
well, brain, brains actually function, right? sort
trained least Western society, think, think logical creatures,
right? like, oh, logical. ultimately everything us can just boil
logic. think enough, going understand make right
decisions, completely not true, right? limbic system, right? emotion
system speak inside us always Trump's logic, right? think about,
ever make sense run burning building? mean, logic says no, right?
someone love burning building, people run right in, right?
limbic system says, yes. logic emotion come head head, emotion wins
time. emotion powerful enough, will always win. limbic system
important limbic system not care clock calendar, right?
answer. also, say repetition compulsion. limbic
system doesn't know like, oh, now, today. may, 2022. just doesn't care
all, right? relate repetition compulsion people
repeating, trying make things right, right? idea
can repeat situation make right, will fix everything, right? makes
perfect sense think, well, concept coming from, right? coming
emotional part brain wants relief suffering trauma not
understand clock calendar. can solve something now, will also solve
something past, right? can't tell many times sat
someone say, starting therapy, right? person will say, oh gosh,
like know, look, just can't help me, right? mean, know, last seven
relationships abusive, right? say back something sometimes like, well,
tell seven relationships abusive different
ways, agree you. Like, say that, 'cause never someone says,
right? think going tell kind relationship
seven times. not seven things, one, right? always, don't think one time
yet failed case. how, think it,
start elucidate going on. make light bulb goes off. Like


not seven different abusive relationships. one repeated seven
times now start getting really going needs happen,
person needs face happened original abusive relationship always
comes sort concepts, person feeling terrified abuse
going on, feeling guilty, feeling ashamed, feeling like, oh, brought
themselves. deserve it. don't deserve anything better, right?
brain trying make sense it, right? thought make okay,
couldn't, right? guilt shame. stuck inside
someone, like bundled inside someone, like medical abscess inside
person, walled off infection inside body, concept brain,
course limb system going want fix that. fixes trying
recreate situation make right time that's, mean, think one
best examples right approach like, look that, talk
that, right? really going there, wait, feel guilty ashamed
person abused person abusing, right? can get
going inside person. changes that. eighth
relationship can entirely different first seven, right? see
time. mean, isn't esoteric soft. Like see play clinically
again. things get better? go trauma unlock it.

00:37:17 Processing Trauma, Always Need Therapist?

not hidden inside can control things, right? bring surface
can take away power. - keep hearing narrative much reflexive
response trauma, emotional repetition compulsion terms
behaviors deep attempt change past. - Yes. - fact,
offline conversation, recall saying something this, that, number
behaviors thoughts avoidance behaviors avoidance thoughts
human beings put trying change past. - [Paul] Right. - remarkable
eerie maladaptive, sounds like. - [Paul] Yes. - really stuck
think want feel like control future feel
moment. extent, works brief while. thing
happened just, evokes internal arousal know
arousal. think many people, including myself,


fundamental question. Okay, thought thing, event events, plural,
evokes arousal, internal states, makes people feel sleepy exhausted.
people feel really anxious. people feel angry. mean arousal
different dimensions know, question like
it. - [Paul] Yes. love hear maybe even just top contour prescriptive
I, one do? even just put it, do? feeling
upset something. feel like options healthy catharsis. tell
story, feel it. could. can pack down. hear bad pack down.
course one functional life deal things. responsibilities
work relational responsibilities, etcetera. need sleep night. catharsis,
healthy catharsis, packing extreme. Telling story. yet think
lot people afraid tell story telling perhaps
reemergence arousal. - Yes. - arousal can become greater, mean. - Yes. -
people mean say things going get worse get
better? mean, guess, simple version long-winded question is, clear
need confront things. can't change past by, reflexive response isn't
going efficiently. deal arousal? one take
feel inside something shameful? moment?
done presence skilled trained therapist
driving work morning something comes up, can't deal right now
comes mind, do? deal right then? know big
multidimensional question. - Yes. - think one lot people grapple
with. want deal things. deal internal arousal? - Yeah,
yeah. often try change trauma past order control future
really adds trauma past dominates present, right?
doesn't way. remember, talking traumas rise
level changing brain. saying, involves re-experience,
involves hyper vigilance, increased arousal. changes mood states, changes
anxiety, changes sleep, changes behavior. changes
sense, push towards dominating present, right? not really living
present, right. trying control future. not going great job
controlling future not really living present, right? way
come moment, saying, okay, moment, need fall
asleep, right? might say, okay, let try put mind. Let try


thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank

trying soothe something stuck inside person isn't letting outside
guilt shame, running around head tormented it.
now pool for, drugs sometimes medicines soothe. So,
opiates given minor surgery, right? like, okay, yeah, help
pain minor surgery, really helping pain inside, right?
quickly turns addiction, danger, risk. see
not theoretical way. Like see people practice
addiction, arising trauma subsequently died.

00:28:23 Deal Trauma & Negative Emotions/Arousal

sort of, writ large existence, modern world. - Incredible
way works. mean idea heard before. think
Freudian concept repetition compulsion. - Yes. - boggles
mind, hearing this, something happens us observe something traumatic.
instead acknowledging trying distance it, seems
reflex shame guilt many cases stuffing away repetition
behaviors continue try just stuff away. - [Paul] Yes. - Like trying
pack, don't know, recently packing home trying get sleeping bag back
bag. seems like always trying mushroom top, kind thing.
takes lot ongoing effort. time thing really exists,
repetition compulsion, people will return kinds scenarios
least kinds emotional states look just like trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
resemble way. question is, repetition compulsion
real thing? wired way? understanding concept
repetition compulsion want solve traumas. - [Paul] Yes. -
allows us put micro again, macro versions
again. get run experiment again. - Right. - attempt solve it. -
Right. - case taking drug clear certain drugs like opioids, clear
not allow us, deal it, right? - [Paul] Yeah. - just masking
emotional state. instance somebody experiences sexual
trauma, places circumstances sexual trauma?
somebody abusive relationship goes second third
fourth verbally, physically abusive relationship? Yeah, mean, face it,


just go, makes no sense. yet see again. - Yes,
first thing say validity repetition compulsion concept, right?
strong yes. Like, yes, see over. not necessarily everyone,
boy, lot people suffered trauma. think good
reason face, surface it, like, makes no sense. think,
well, brain, brains actually function, right? sort
trained least Western society, think, think logical creatures,
right? like, oh, logical. ultimately everything us can just boil
logic. think enough, going understand make right
decisions, completely not true, right? limbic system, right? emotion
system speak inside us always Trump's logic, right? think about,
ever make sense run burning building? mean, logic says no, right?
someone love burning building, people run right in, right?
limbic system says, yes. logic emotion come head head, emotion wins
time. emotion powerful enough, will always win. limbic system
important limbic system not care clock calendar, right?
answer. also, say repetition compulsion. limbic
system doesn't know like, oh, now, today. may, 2022. just doesn't care
all, right? relate repetition compulsion people
repeating, trying make things right, right? idea
can repeat situation make right, will fix everything, right? makes
perfect sense think, well, concept coming from, right? coming
emotional part brain wants relief suffering trauma not
understand clock calendar. can solve something now, will also solve
something past, right? can't tell many times sat
someone say, starting therapy, right? person will say, oh gosh,
like know, look, just can't help me, right? mean, know, last seven
relationships abusive, right? say back something sometimes like, well,
tell seven relationships abusive different
ways, agree you. Like, say that, 'cause never someone says,
right? think going tell kind relationship
seven times. not seven things, one, right? always, don't think one time
yet failed case. how, think it,
start elucidate going on. make light bulb goes off. Like


not seven different abusive relationships. one repeated seven
times now start getting really going needs happen,
person needs face happened original abusive relationship always
comes sort concepts, person feeling terrified abuse
going on, feeling guilty, feeling ashamed, feeling like, oh, brought
themselves. deserve it. don't deserve anything better, right?
brain trying make sense it, right? thought make okay,
couldn't, right? guilt shame. stuck inside
someone, like bundled inside someone, like medical abscess inside
person, walled off infection inside body, concept brain,
course limb system going want fix that. fixes trying
recreate situation make right time that's, mean, think one
best examples right approach like, look that, talk
that, right? really going there, wait, feel guilty ashamed
person abused person abusing, right? can get
going inside person. changes that. eighth
relationship can entirely different first seven, right? see
time. mean, isn't esoteric soft. Like see play clinically
again. things get better? go trauma unlock it.

00:37:17 Processing Trauma, Always Need Therapist?

not hidden inside can control things, right? bring surface
can take away power. - keep hearing narrative much reflexive
response trauma, emotional repetition compulsion terms
behaviors deep attempt change past. - Yes. - fact,
offline conversation, recall saying something this, that, number
behaviors thoughts avoidance behaviors avoidance thoughts
human beings put trying change past. - [Paul] Right. - remarkable
eerie maladaptive, sounds like. - [Paul] Yes. - really stuck
think want feel like control future feel
moment. extent, works brief while. thing
happened just, evokes internal arousal know
arousal. think many people, including myself,


fundamental question. Okay, thought thing, event events, plural,
evokes arousal, internal states, makes people feel sleepy exhausted.
people feel really anxious. people feel angry. mean arousal
different dimensions know, question like
it. - [Paul] Yes. love hear maybe even just top contour prescriptive
I, one do? even just put it, do? feeling
upset something. feel like options healthy catharsis. tell
story, feel it. could. can pack down. hear bad pack down.
course one functional life deal things. responsibilities
work relational responsibilities, etcetera. need sleep night. catharsis,
healthy catharsis, packing extreme. Telling story. yet think
lot people afraid tell story telling perhaps
reemergence arousal. - Yes. - arousal can become greater, mean. - Yes. -
people mean say things going get worse get
better? mean, guess, simple version long-winded question is, clear
need confront things. can't change past by, reflexive response isn't
going efficiently. deal arousal? one take
feel inside something shameful? moment?
done presence skilled trained therapist
driving work morning something comes up, can't deal right now
comes mind, do? deal right then? know big
multidimensional question. - Yes. - think one lot people grapple
with. want deal things. deal internal arousal? - Yeah,
yeah. often try change trauma past order control future
really adds trauma past dominates present, right?
doesn't way. remember, talking traumas rise
level changing brain. saying, involves re-experience,
involves hyper vigilance, increased arousal. changes mood states, changes
anxiety, changes sleep, changes behavior. changes
sense, push towards dominating present, right? not really living
present, right. trying control future. not going great job
controlling future not really living present, right? way
come moment, saying, okay, moment, need fall
asleep, right? might say, okay, let try put mind. Let try


thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

just go, makes no sense. yet see again. - Yes,
first thing say validity repetition compulsion concept, right?
strong yes. Like, yes, see over. not necessarily everyone,
boy, lot people suffered trauma. think good
reason face, surface it, like, makes no sense. think,
well, brain, brains actually function, right? sort
trained least Western society, think, think logical creatures,
right? like, oh, logical. ultimately everything us can just boil
logic. think enough, going understand make right
decisions, completely not true, right? limbic system, right? emotion
system speak inside us always Trump's logic, right? think about,
ever make sense run burning building? mean, logic says no, right?
someone love burning building, people run right in, right?
limbic system says, yes. logic emotion come head head, emotion wins
time. emotion powerful enough, will always win. limbic system
important limbic system not care clock calendar, right?
answer. also, say repetition compulsion. limbic
system doesn't know like, oh, now, today. may, 2022. just doesn't care
all, right? relate repetition compulsion people
repeating, trying make things right, right? idea
can repeat situation make right, will fix everything, right? makes
perfect sense think, well, concept coming from, right? coming
emotional part brain wants relief suffering trauma not
understand clock calendar. can solve something now, will also solve
something past, right? can't tell many times sat
someone say, starting therapy, right? person will say, oh gosh,
like know, look, just can't help me, right? mean, know, last seven
relationships abusive, right? say back something sometimes like, well,
tell seven relationships abusive different
ways, agree you. Like, say that, 'cause never someone says,
right? think going tell kind relationship
seven times. not seven things, one, right? always, don't think one time
yet failed case. how, think it,
start elucidate going on. make light bulb goes off. Like


not seven different abusive relationships. one repeated seven
times now start getting really going needs happen,
person needs face happened original abusive relationship always
comes sort concepts, person feeling terrified abuse
going on, feeling guilty, feeling ashamed, feeling like, oh, brought
themselves. deserve it. don't deserve anything better, right?
brain trying make sense it, right? thought make okay,
couldn't, right? guilt shame. stuck inside
someone, like bundled inside someone, like medical abscess inside
person, walled off infection inside body, concept brain,
course limb system going want fix that. fixes trying
recreate situation make right time that's, mean, think one
best examples right approach like, look that, talk
that, right? really going there, wait, feel guilty ashamed
person abused person abusing, right? can get
going inside person. changes that. eighth
relationship can entirely different first seven, right? see
time. mean, isn't esoteric soft. Like see play clinically
again. things get better? go trauma unlock it.

00:37:17 Processing Trauma, Always Need Therapist?

not hidden inside can control things, right? bring surface
can take away power. - keep hearing narrative much reflexive
response trauma, emotional repetition compulsion terms
behaviors deep attempt change past. - Yes. - fact,
offline conversation, recall saying something this, that, number
behaviors thoughts avoidance behaviors avoidance thoughts
human beings put trying change past. - [Paul] Right. - remarkable
eerie maladaptive, sounds like. - [Paul] Yes. - really stuck
think want feel like control future feel
moment. extent, works brief while. thing
happened just, evokes internal arousal know
arousal. think many people, including myself,


fundamental question. Okay, thought thing, event events, plural,
evokes arousal, internal states, makes people feel sleepy exhausted.
people feel really anxious. people feel angry. mean arousal
different dimensions know, question like
it. - [Paul] Yes. love hear maybe even just top contour prescriptive
I, one do? even just put it, do? feeling
upset something. feel like options healthy catharsis. tell
story, feel it. could. can pack down. hear bad pack down.

yeah. often try change trauma past order control future
really adds trauma past dominates present, right?
doesn't way. remember, talking traumas rise
level changing brain. saying, involves re-experience,
involves hyper vigilance, increased arousal. changes mood states, changes
anxiety, changes sleep, changes behavior. changes
sense, push towards dominating present, right? not really living
present, right. trying control future. not going great job
controlling future not really living present, right? way
come moment, saying, okay, moment, need fall

thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes

just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]

taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure

not seven different abusive relationships. one repeated seven
times now start getting really going needs happen,
person needs face happened original abusive relationship always
comes sort concepts, person feeling terrified abuse
going on, feeling guilty, feeling ashamed, feeling like, oh, brought
themselves. deserve it. don't deserve anything better, right?
brain trying make sense it, right? thought make okay,
couldn't, right? guilt shame. stuck inside
someone, like bundled inside someone, like medical abscess inside
person, walled off infection inside body, concept brain,
course limb system going want fix that. fixes trying
recreate situation make right time that's, mean, think one
best examples right approach like, look that, talk
that, right? really going there, wait, feel guilty ashamed
person abused person abusing, right? can get
going inside person. changes that. eighth
relationship can entirely different first seven, right? see
time. mean, isn't esoteric soft. Like see play clinically
again. things get better? go trauma unlock it.

00:37:17 Processing Trauma, Always Need Therapist?

not hidden inside can control things, right? bring surface
can take away power. - keep hearing narrative much reflexive
response trauma, emotional repetition compulsion terms
behaviors deep attempt change past. - Yes. - fact,
offline conversation, recall saying something this, that, number
behaviors thoughts avoidance behaviors avoidance thoughts
human beings put trying change past. - [Paul] Right. - remarkable
eerie maladaptive, sounds like. - [Paul] Yes. - really stuck
think want feel like control future feel
moment. extent, works brief while. thing
happened just, evokes internal arousal know
arousal. think many people, including myself,


fundamental question. Okay, thought thing, event events, plural,
evokes arousal, internal states, makes people feel sleepy exhausted.
people feel really anxious. people feel angry. mean arousal
different dimensions know, question like
it. - [Paul] Yes. love hear maybe even just top contour prescriptive
I, one do? even just put it, do? feeling
upset something. feel like options healthy catharsis. tell
story, feel it. could. can pack down. hear bad pack down.
course one functional life deal things. responsibilities
work relational responsibilities, etcetera. need sleep night. catharsis,
healthy catharsis, packing extreme. Telling story. yet think
lot people afraid tell story telling perhaps
reemergence arousal. - Yes. - arousal can become greater, mean. - Yes. -
people mean say things going get worse get
better? mean, guess, simple version long-winded question is, clear
need confront things. can't change past by, reflexive response isn't
going efficiently. deal arousal? one take
feel inside something shameful? moment?
done presence skilled trained therapist
driving work morning something comes up, can't deal right now
comes mind, do? deal right then? know big
multidimensional question. - Yes. - think one lot people grapple
with. want deal things. deal internal arousal? - Yeah,
yeah. often try change trauma past order control future
really adds trauma past dominates present, right?
doesn't way. remember, talking traumas rise
level changing brain. saying, involves re-experience,
involves hyper vigilance, increased arousal. changes mood states, changes
anxiety, changes sleep, changes behavior. changes
sense, push towards dominating present, right? not really living
present, right. trying control future. not going great job
controlling future not really living present, right? way
come moment, saying, okay, moment, need fall
asleep, right? might say, okay, let try put mind. Let try


thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today

background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,

fundamental question. Okay, thought thing, event events, plural,
evokes arousal, internal states, makes people feel sleepy exhausted.
people feel really anxious. people feel angry. mean arousal
different dimensions know, question like
it. - [Paul] Yes. love hear maybe even just top contour prescriptive
I, one do? even just put it, do? feeling
upset something. feel like options healthy catharsis. tell
story, feel it. could. can pack down. hear bad pack down.
course one functional life deal things. responsibilities
work relational responsibilities, etcetera. need sleep night. catharsis,
healthy catharsis, packing extreme. Telling story. yet think
lot people afraid tell story telling perhaps
reemergence arousal. - Yes. - arousal can become greater, mean. - Yes. -
people mean say things going get worse get
better? mean, guess, simple version long-winded question is, clear
need confront things. can't change past by, reflexive response isn't
going efficiently. deal arousal? one take
feel inside something shameful? moment?
done presence skilled trained therapist
driving work morning something comes up, can't deal right now
comes mind, do? deal right then? know big
multidimensional question. - Yes. - think one lot people grapple
with. want deal things. deal internal arousal? - Yeah,
yeah. often try change trauma past order control future
really adds trauma past dominates present, right?
doesn't way. remember, talking traumas rise
level changing brain. saying, involves re-experience,
involves hyper vigilance, increased arousal. changes mood states, changes
anxiety, changes sleep, changes behavior. changes
sense, push towards dominating present, right? not really living
present, right. trying control future. not going great job
controlling future not really living present, right? way
come moment, saying, okay, moment, need fall
asleep, right? might say, okay, let try put mind. Let try


thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

thought redirect. short term strategies can let us functional
context changes. answer go look directly thing, right? Look
trauma, explore trauma, sure. can done professional.
sometimes makes sense, not always, right? Sometimes can done
talking another person, right? Writing down, right? Look going inside
me, mind stuck this. explore almost we're,
afraid, often looking trauma changed us, look
anywhere. that, right? like hidden closet shine light
everywhere else, not going open door. people will say
heard over. thought times like, oh,
talk that, going start crying never stop, right? going just fall
apart, right? never happens. No one ever starts crying never stops,
right? ends happening person puts words it, right?
writing, talking trusted therapist, right? Things start
change. mean, just fact can talk it, can put words
people don't recoil, right? mean, many times someone said something
first time, right? telling trauma, anxious,
like looking like going be, going recoil it, right? Meaning going
recoil them, right? sense surprise person says, well,
know, abused coach kid, right? not a, okay,
not response recoiling. can see change people will say lot,
like, wow. Like, can't believe like can like, hear say okay it,
right? mean, think going inside them. Like how, sense
shame, sense of, something awful people recoil
just not true, trauma is, insidious, right? pervasive, right?
convinces us continually hide away, explore it?
example person says, okay, abused coach child.
mean, thinking couple, real cases, right? People taken care of.
start talking it, start talking how, , just
innocent kids, right? like, didn't know. like, really wanted
team coach treating special. now can look
outside, right? can look like look
someone else, right? think easy us see real true,
someone else, right? ask someone, think someone 10, 11


years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

years old, abused manipulated abused adult? say, oh
goodness, feel compassion person, right? us right then, oh no, guilt
shame hide away. person starts looking it,
can sort see outside. starts take energy it, right? Then,
well, feel guilty that? done something wrong? like, now
conceptions come together, often reflexive, fault. Oh, it.
went back it. still stayed team. went back next season, right? let happen
again, right? guilt shame inside person gets juxtaposed like,
really happened there? say, right. terrified child, right? didn't
understand all. can come place compassion. now
working guilt shame. person cries it, great,
right? mean, crying one best coping mechanisms have. doesn't hurt us.
lets us grieve things. Yeah, can't grieve guilt shame inside us,
just blocks grief, right? to, clean slate sense order
feel sadness. see shifts anxiety, anger, frustration, usually
directed towards self, guilt shame towards, towards able process
able bring bear compassion able direct negative
emotions, speak warranted goodness, changes
happen. mean, not like people miraculously cured, right? remarkable
just getting like one hour talking like that,

00:45:30 Internal Self-talk, Punishing Narratives & Negative Fantasies

like talking now can leave person feeling immensely better. -
seems hearing this, weird wiring have,
hearing traumas happen us observe them, need
confront emotions around directly. - [Paul] Yes. instead
system defaults guilt, shame. - [Paul] Yes. - trying hide it. - [Paul] Yes.
repetition compulsion placing us back things similar traumas. even
maybe even worse traumas. - [Paul] Yes. - attempt resolve it. like
maladaptive. - [Andrew] Wiring diagram. possibly think of. - Yes. - Emotional
presumably physiological wiring diagram. - [Paul] Yes. notion trying
change past things now, exact opposite going
beneficial also seems like complete, whole system seems completely backwards.


I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

I'm, chuckling say this, not amused just baffled
wiring can often not serve us well. raises an, think
important interesting question, earlier, talking
people will seek media really disturbing. traumatize re-traumatize
daily basis. viewed repetition compulsion
person will relationship seven different, abusive relationship
seven different partners sequence seems terrible. yet, say this, also
becoming clear almost seems like poor, desperate attempt
resolve way. - Yes. - fork road, understand correctly,
really get seed incident, really get thing started all, opposed
repeating all. - [Paul] Yes. - done presence therapist?
benefit taking walk thinking things, breaking
crying, necessary feeling angrier, comes up? reason
ask way worry, just speak experience, worry
reactivating touching emotions around something form
repetition compulsion, feeling again. - [Paul] Right. - not
seeking something evoke feeling. realize little bit circular
argument, right? question. think one really struggle trying
parse the, outcome based therapies hear recommendations
people make. mean, conceptualize this? Something happens.
Sounds like need deal thing directly. need
somebody else? Can own? we're, don't resources
own, can't hire someone, can't pay someone work us. - [Paul]
Right. - way isn't retraumatizing ourself major way,
minor way. know landscape? - Right. Again,
are, think, great questions. think starts real introspection. things
bouncing around minds, often, very, non-productive right? thing
again, not helpful us, right? idea
sometimes gets called observing ego, right? ability stop look
going inside ourselves. just thinking thinking
way, sort of, sense, always think it,
reinforcing trauma, right? can distance enough like, huh, it's,
interested going inside me, right? can think certain person
really loves music. mean, point therapy work, learned like


taking long drives, the, radio wasn't on. like, well, going
on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -
welcome. take heart appreciative

on, right? asked, going running
head, like, loser, loser, right? didn't want music
music drown felt say herself, right?
like, wow, interesting, right? ability observe think,
comes mind? Like, trace to,
start that? Like say, know, saying point exaggeration, like,
nobody comes womb programmed think loser, right? don't think
born, right? come from? Then, can think ways
allow us new thoughts, right? weren't having, not just bouncing
around minds. speak write, even mechanisms
come online brains, right? sort monitoring mechanisms. think
different way, using words, right? better able often bring
observing ego, like going inside me? can helpful think,
can helpful talk someone, trusted other, know, friend, family, clergy
write, mean, things can done without expending resources, right?
sometimes can make really big difference, right? way, start
thinking that? like, interestingly, case, okay, therapy,
became clear rooted to, right? therapy,
still relatively young, done several sessions weren't talking
needed talk about, right? got us needed talk
about. start, now place exploring
reflex sense guilt sense shame.
came just got boiled loser, right? person didn't
even mind. Like, didn't think way, right?
interesting, right? memories don't meaning like
flat colorless, right? colored emotions attach
them, right? So, idea certain memories now, trauma changed,
right? trauma. tell story, sometimes person like won award
high school thought was, oh gosh, like shows, like
can it, right? get there, trauma, saw award negative
emotion attached it. like, oh, given didn't deserve it.
almost mocking. Like, going greatest achievement life
17 so, someone think like, not felt


time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -
welcome. take heart appreciative

time. trauma changed, self talk, internal state going forward
talking miraculous negative way, also changed going backward, right?
can really look that, like come from? can start
unraveling it, changes. cases, know, often helpful good
therapist, not always necessary. certainly, not always possible, right?
need strategies. those, write book
can sort get trauma without formalized mechanisms. sometimes
symptoms significant enough, like really need talk somebody
professional can help us get root trauma. many times,
answer going people. People seen five
residential stays. not exaggerating this, mental health reasons, substance
reasons, no one's ever taken trauma history, right? take
trauma history, say, well, obviously coming from, right? Like
drug use started truly thereafter, negative self talk negative
feelings led drug use. go trauma can change
things. Whereas trying change things without looking,

00:51:10 Short-Term Coping Mechanisms vs. Long-Term Change

introspecting, talking trauma, think course futile. - think
people can start negative fantasies? mean, mentioned woman
take long drives berate herself. not familiar that, I'll, give
little bit personal disclosure here. felt several times life will start
create narrative something truly hasn't happened something terrible
somebody going do. - [Paul] Yes. - going upset me. - [Paul] Yes. -
longest time, wonder this? couple ideas why,
one, attempting just avoid thinking things. just, know,
anger attractive emotional force this. attracting, not attractive.
don't like it. yet, oftentimes anger great way replace feeling something else. -
[Paul] Yes. - Feeling sad come work something useful.
kind like gravitational force it. one idea. idea
imagining kind worst outcomes, actually relationship were,
actually seem lot better reality. - Hm hm. - [Andrew] almost like creating
negative contrast. - Yes. like, oh, well not bad. third


possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

possibility no idea why, seemed like reflex. spent time
thinking it. can't say resolved completely, somebody
narrative default narrative driving walking just going spend
time think terrible thing going turn someone's
going upset harm terrible am. seems, again, like maladaptive
thinking, maladaptive wiring. yet assume serves purpose. -
Yeah, yeah. mean, think three factors bad. think
spoke least two them, right? think speak powerfully
insidious trauma real brain changes inside us. say
three factors, punishment, avoidance control, right? trauma inside
us, makes guilt shame. often, often leads desire punish oneself,
right? idea that, oh, fault. deserve that. Well,
something someone's fault someone now deserves punishment, right? mean,
punish them, right? send 'em jail, give fine, right? punish
them. what, punish ourselves, right? tell
loser awful thing going happen, right? part
saying ourselves, see, right, deserve that. not going anything
better, right? negative. negative way brain tries make us
sense, better hurting us things couldn't shouldn't
able to, weren't expected control first place, right? second
distraction. said, anger, kind fantasy can distract us affect feeling
emotion. can much negative. Anger, can gratifying
certainly guilt shame, although guilt shame can serve punishment purpose.
anger directed also towards ourselves, right, can serve punishment too.
punishment, avoidance, sense control think ahead something
awful, imagining going happen, well, maybe will let avoid it,
right? mean, can see brain sense, really confused. mean, part
brain wants punish. part brain doesn't want think part
brain wants make better. resolves, not aware that,
hey, context brains deeply impacted trauma.
going maladaptive, right? 'Cause negative fantasies future,
may help us feel better something present, don't help us make
anything better, right? don't help us make anything better. kind
sequela. trauma reflexive stuff happens trauma


ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

ultimately lead us. can see get lost, seen
life, lives people, man get stuck situations
see people sometimes. going 30 years, 40 years, right?
just going no natural end
this, right? Unless we, look different way, knowledge
information like, whoa, isn't way be. Let bring novel
perspective this. doesn't change own. - struck statement
thoughts behaviors can make us feel better, don't actually make
anything better. way, mode imagining terrible outcomes starts
immediately seem like taking opioids. feel better moment, doesn't
actually make anything better. probably makes things worse. - Yes. - just
question much worse direction, yes. just want just pause
concept, think concept makes us feel better, doesn't make
anything better.

00:53:22 Tools: Processing Trauma Own, Journaling

think answers earlier question seems totally maladaptive wiring
diagram. need confront thing, don't want go repetition
compulsion. knife edge there, navigate trauma. - [Paul] Yes. -
Working skilled clinician like yourself, think ideal circumstance
people. course people can't access support somebody,
whatever reason. talked journaling. - Hmm, yes. - useful tool.
maybe highlight things people can own.
also like talk makes good therapist. people look
seeking therapy, especially nowadays lot therapy
done remotely, just start the, just call self-generated zero cost
sorts things, journaling first others
kind structure recommend someone put around journaling, carry journal
around day jot things come sit spend hour
writing complete sentences, instance. - Yeah. add something
just said question, right? short-term coping
mechanisms us, right? way makes sense, right? find just
terrible situations, short-term coping mechanism can get us them, right?


brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today

background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,

brains built way part survival too, right? whether now
modern world, whether food, drugs, sex, alcohol, right? negative
thoughts, right? short-term soothing. Even negative thoughts, anger
short-term soothing expense long-term change, right?
addictive pathways can come play. where, again, our, built
evolutionarily survival, doesn't help us, know, way humans evolved.
Like haven't lived way throughout, 99.9% something percent human history,
right? not adapted this. want just make point saying

00:57:00 Sublimination Traumatic Experiences

short-term soothing expense long-term change,
question asked say journaling can outside
professional. think hallmark bringing new eyes it, right? Like
thinking self curiosity, instead just simple automaticity repetition,
right? Like, thinking this? start? me? Right?
Whether words whether writing, important. think journaling,
depends person. mean, don't want somebody carrying around journal
day, compulsion to, need write everything going
mind, right? Like might good okay. Write little bit night, right?
someone might think, sometimes really comes mind strong way
unpredictable, right? want journal me. So, ah, thing
back mind now, let write it, right? putting words
able read words, right? people read, even little bit
journaling read like, oh, thought terrible person
can't good life, bad car accident person
attacked school, bullied looked different
everyone else, right? acted different everyone else. Wow, actually see
written out. little bit that, little bit that. Like saying
someone someone else, right? now enough distance
it. Like looking words wrote, right? get distance can
start integrate the, not just compassion, integrating compassion
logic, right? like, okay. feel sense compassion now, wait, mean?
really happened here, right? gosh, start thinking differently that.


started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today

psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming

started, came from, right? saying this, kind
revelations can again, written spoken word. think
again, involves trusted other, writing, right? think ways
can this, bring de novo perspective something often
bouncing around inside us. amazing that, can see intelligent
empathically, attuned people who've thing running
mind years. just points brains don't automatically say, hey,
wait second. spinning wheels long, long time. Like,
another way look this? need something outside, can just
knowledge, right? think reason wrote
book wrote like, apprehending like amazing surprise me, right?
like, wow, like huge percentage everything treating rooted trauma
opacity trauma, right? don't see that, oh, depression,
panic attacks, life change, addiction, maladaptive choices like, oh,
coming trauma hides opacity. need de novo
perspective own. need therapy,
might link like finding right therapist, right? also part question.
- Yeah, yeah definitely want know assess find right therapist.
cover that, however,

01:02:34 Tool: Finding Good Therapist

something came course answer. can immediately relate idea
certain behaviors really maladaptive stuffing things avoiding
topic problematic bringing curiosity introspection almost third
personing experience order try address new,
truly new perspective. occurred discussing this, however
people, yes, maybe talking little bit experience.
sense identity people view us ability functional
world ways like, effective work good brother good mother father,
human world. relationships. think one thing
heard, maybe experienced sometimes maladaptive thoughts
behaviors, things generate kind repetition anger arousal
activation sadness, internal process funnel


functionality world. give concrete example. thinking
things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]

office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -

things upset past imagining bad outcomes future,
certain internal state arousal comes about. many years,
able use that, not feel angry, rather work extra three hours day - [Paul]
Right. - pack schedule work social engagement. show
way I, hopefully good brother sister instance. - [Paul] Right. -
way a, transformation something negative inside me. - [Paul]
Yes. - functionality world actually rewarding beneficial. -
[Paul] Yes. - yet describing it, can immediately see wonderful
source something else. - [Paul] Hm- hm. - yet I, can imagine,
can imagine one reluctant, maybe even terrified giving source. -
Yes. - [ Andrew] fuel. - Yes. think knowing traumas
people reluctance work those, obviously not therapist, sense
again, one's positive identity can often linked something
difficult past. - [Paul] Yes. - people reluctant give fuel. -
[Paul] Yes. - sense, functional. thing allowed
kind start address still curious this, 'cause don't think
worked process completely, again, little self-disclosure there,
told words, just imagine much better
source different fuel, fuel felt better. - Right. - Maybe the,
this, sentence. was, maybe actually much effective. - [Paul]
Yes. - Maybe 10 times better brother. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe
10 times insight work capacity, etcetera. hint promise
I, least inspired start looking things reading trauma
book elsewhere, start think this. again, realize long
winded question somewhat complex idea, think, hope people will
able resonate idea sometimes want stay attached short
term soothing punishment distraction control evokes arousal
can apply arousal. - Yes, yes. think describing maps
think clinically gets called sublimation. something negative inside
us, sort transfer energy, transfer something adaptive
positive, right? idea anger, right? think thing
makes anger me, channel harder work, right? channel like,
going go nicer brothers, right, something like that. validity


that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

that, right? can become like self justifying person thinks, well, look
me, right? wouldn't work hard without it. Right now start
become attached trauma. Whereas think said absolutely true
just can sublimate negative affect, feeling, emotion
comes trauma something productive doesn't mean best, right?
mean can get destination taking circuitous route, right? might
waste hour getting there, get there. doesn't mean best.
also doesn't look negative, right? example, wasted fuel, wasted
time, right? get somewhere, not optimizing. yet see one
person addressed trauma become less functional, right? always
either, just functional, happier, right? functional
said, like, just may able sublimate, well, maybe going
will 10 times better, right? weren't sublimating sublimation limits us,
right? limits perspective can see lens
trauma. never better alternative. - Thank that. - Yeah,
welcome, yeah.

01:07:20 Optimizing Therapy Process, Frequency, Intensity

- discuss one go finding really good therapist.
Typically experience, done word mouth. person might
want work really great, characteristics
one look for? take account whether not
person instance, heard listeners, although clearly, definitely
not talking cloaking something. people will say, want
work somatic therapist actually heard someone say, think fields,
feel stuff body. want work someone can really acknowledge
someone else will say, want work somebody orientation
orientation open particular lifestyle, isn't going tell
leave relationship. feel like people already show question work
these, know, things internally, voiced
aren't. love talk maybe the, core features
really good therapist look therapist. also think
oneself looking therapist. - [Paul] Right. - kind


predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today

psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming

predispositions. - [Paul] Right, right. Well, lot data years,
look top 10 important factors find therapist, just repeat
rapport 10 times, right? mean, key. think that, pretty
amazing, right? therapeutic modalities can different, right? think
telling us is, way, something obvious, right? Like rapport
mean? Like, know, somebody paying attention, right? trust, back
forth. like, yeah. even though something difficult,
someone really helping me, someone me, right? Someone
really paying attention. Wants better. indispensable, mean, just
indispensable. write book someone, therapist not making eye contact
way it, right? know, got fit box way
it. not going helpful. I, think
different modalities. doesn't actually tell us that, oh, modalities irrelevant. think
not true. think good therapists not pigeonholed certain modality.
may come world largely psychodynamic CBT DBT lens.
lots different, ways therapy. really talk people,
really good experience therapists, coming vehicle rapport,
practically shifting person needs. don't understand idea like,
oh, just this, right? don't that. people pigeonholed way,
don't think help patients well, right? diverse enough say,
hey, want arrows quiver, right? even though might one
favor lens see things through, no, can versatile, can shift, can
adapt person needs. think that, got to,
that, got winning combination. - Great, people perhaps try
therapists maybe session two three see they, rapport feels like
taking root. that? - [Paul] Yeah. - right? - Yeah, think
word mouth important, right? someone trust tells you, hey, good
person says lot, right? already makes pretest probability, quite high.
yes, interesting see like people therapist called
insurance assigned therapist. thought like, oh, person
now. like, no, look like anyone
interviewing, right, job, right? got bring again, right set thoughts
helped, right? want someone rapport me. don't
want someone going make easy, right? like, well, it's, gosh, kind


pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -
welcome. take heart appreciative

pleasant, means not talking difficult things, right?
one brings, like, know isn't going easy. got talk difficult things,
right? Even one doesn't recognize got talk trauma me, right?
go therapy thinking, no, it's, mean, sometimes enjoyable, lot times, right,
not, right? hard work. can excruciating. can cry it, say, right,
going helped. want someone going
me, really looking at, going inside me, help me? can
feel sort robustness that. one brings approach looks
therapist lens, likely move someone not
good choice, right? really stick someone is, even though doesn't mean
always like pleasant

01:14:51 Tool: Self-Awareness Therapy Needs, Mismatch Needs

enjoyable. mean, not sometimes. - Right. Maybe drill
little deeper mechanics therapy. put questions audience asking
want know therapy amazing. got hundreds, not
thousands responses saying, show therapy? instance,
people take five minute meditative drop before? just show
cold let emerge. therapy, good idea take notes not take notes
post therapy, clients, patients sometimes called, one
other, never know which, process information?
take designated time afterwards ideal world, take 30 minute walk
afterwards think material set aside come back it?
course constraints, work family, etcetera. know we, lot
knowledge best show workout, warm five, 10
minutes, this, etcetera cool down. mean, here, talking
hard psychological work aimed bettering oneself. knowledge, not ever
seen information anywhere. It'd useful hear, hear thoughts this. -
Yeah. Well, not trying duck question, think varies much person.
think first part question, think show
therapy, right? think answer whatever lets fully present
therapy. Now people going be, show early, say it, call
myself, meditate little bit. mean, present, right?


people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.

people, know, just, show up, walk room, can stop another
present, right? whatever works person. really there,
thoughts, energy really going on. thing applies
end. people really well served by, going walk can,
sitting quietly therapy, kind putting order, right? Otherwise lose
it, right? like ahas, right? the, oh, interesting thought
really need put order. Maybe involves taking notes
therapy, right? people, need exact opposite. need like
leave, not think all. can reflect later learn it.
different. Human beings, diversity us no hard
answer that, like present happening, able sort
consolidate retain gained important. think
figure person person. mean, try work like
serving person best. sometimes we, sometimes evolves sometimes
talk it, varies much. - Hmm. - someone thinking embarking
therapy therapy address trauma just general issues life,
frequency recommend? imagine two extreme models. One is, okay,
going finally tackle trauma. going therapy three times week,
shorter period time, six months, versus open ended model
week, typically long takes. - Right, right. think also varies. work
people varied ways oh, someone well like meet
half hour every six months, right? week long, hourly sessions, spending
three intense days someone row, right? think far like kind guiding
principles, found life, 'cause value therapy
tremendously. found life clinical work less
week, hard us retain really. spend lot time kind catching
up, okay, happened? get back place before, right?
think really going get somewhere, not just trying maintain
something, right? think week hour really kind minimum,
right? intensive work. like intense is, not linear, right?
exponential gain. Like lot intensive work, right? someone will come
30 clinical hours us course week. five six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours. know, found benefits
immense. like say year's worth therapy consolidated take well,


30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

30 hours, say, go almost every week, maybe 45 50 hours, 30 hours
kind intensity worth probably 60 hours, done different way,
us active way, right? therapist active way, becomes
very, dynamic. think turning intensity, something really
need process, absolutely makes sense. life something
now's like, whoa, really, somebody really distressing linking prior
trauma can see going me. Now start ruminative thoughts,
know, negativity, like, got go more, right? got
processing. can get place am, not that, not trauma
no impact me, right? It' impact much less
therapy often often not ability see
now intruding thoughts. taking away like really think
believe, able draw logic emotion together make good decisions.
Turning intensity absolutely makes sense. - deep, intensive work
30 hours week. brings somebody some, type work sort?
suicide risk severe addiction situation? mean, one gauge much
therapy always therapist decide
frequency? bring someone situation five therapists 30 hours
week one week? - Right, right. Yeah, usually person really distressed
something whether that's, negatively impacting life sometimes person
comes realization. just can't take anymore, right? sick cyclical
depression. got stop panic attacks. need help, right? usually some,
crisis point idea crisis meaning of, okay, something comes head
it, things going different, right? Not crisis things going
negative afterwards, point where, cognitive flexibility comes
fore like, well, need something different, right? often brings us.
Sometimes people pointing somebody's intervention
somewhere yes, person's hospitalized suicide attempt
gone back rehab third fourth time. life really danger.
Sometimes that. sometimes person realizing, yeah, just want to, want
look myself, want understand better. know going me,
isn't good can be, right?

00:16:35 Self-talk & Journaling, Talking Trusted Individuals



think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue

think people can come sorts different ways. think, yes, think
lot times therapist say, work, intensive work can make
difference. think person also needs to, take ownership, right?
therapy say, don't feel helped enough, well, think that, right?
talk therapist that, 'cause it, maybe therapist isn't match, right?
maybe talk therapist therapist can change approach, right?
maybe talk therapist increase frequency, right? idea
aware it, right? one's needs, aren't met acknowledge that, right?
'Cause people can get rhythm therapy really not helping them, right?
either feel sort nihilistic it. Like, oh, no better going
therapy, right? sometimes sense therapy, kind
checking box something myself, not really getting anywhere.
part brain controlled guilt shame avoidance
thinks great idea, right? again, ability observe like
going on, helped way, feel helped, right?
ways, even like happy not feeling helped. 'Cause don't face thing
don't want face, right? afraid say need help, right? really
need look ourselves? insurance systems often
difficult, 'cause hard sometimes person say, need therapy 'cause
may not possible, right? sort negative factors world around us.
ultimately think answer question comes observing
taking ownership like going us feeling. feeling
that, commitment self self-care say, need go change this. -
maybe don't means insurance access even one day
week therapy journaling model. - [Paul] Yes. - one perhaps take entire
day awful might seem, lot journaling thinking walking,
self-generated intensive. think utility that? - mean be,
depends person 'cause also something negative
someone not point, not ready that, right? mean don't come at,
don't come directly trauma immediately, least time don't
that, right? often don't explore depth. Like idea that, oh, person now
go every second trauma actually not true. mean sometimes
is, that's, not common situation, right? often person


acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

acknowledge like example like sexually abused acknowledge
to, say, okay, like, gosh, done me? doesn't mean,
well parse every moment like terror that, right?
can lead people worse place, right? So, think idea biting off small
pieces, speak person writing, right? talking. think one
writing, good communicate another, right? Another trusted person.
not someone one's personal life, clergy members, even one isn't
affiliated organized religion, probably go places get clergy want
help you, right? mean, people want help people.
say, someone no one, mean, almost never no one here,
right? 'Cause probably go find someone, need kind take
pieces. risk like trying intensive thing, know, one's
own. put in, person's suicidal thoughts even
thoughts death, not wanting alive, don't deserve alive. mean,
warning signs really getting help. signs say, hey, don't try
own, right? Go try find resource. things get
level severity of, often person knows that. mean, place know
not healthy kind scary thoughts, need, person
really shouldn't own.

01:19:00 Prescription Drugs & Treating Trauma, Antidepressants, Treating Core Issues

- Great, thank that. - Yeah, welcome. - talking lot
talking. - Huhm. - now like talk little bit chemistry. - Yes. - Drugs. -
[Paul] Yes. - maybe first talk prescription drugs. mean
psychiatrist, approved to, presumably prescribe medication
appropriate. mean, vast landscape course. got ADHD
just tell you, get questions ADHD drugs related ADHD
dopamine topic, topic. ADHD, OCD,
depression, antidepressants forth. way can, wrap
arms around way waiting this, drug question just
address, one decide medication useful? end,
dissection tool psychiatrist therapist language. point, one
make assessment dopamine serotonin whether not given drug


help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

help. therapies, believe don't involve putting someone brain
scanner. knowledge, still not good blood test assess, oh,
person's dopamine low high, correct wrong. ultimately that,
know companies there, not trying undermine companies.
happen statement, take blood test find
serotonin metabolites low, understanding possible low
serotonin brain, indirect window really going on.
does, think prescription drugs context treating trauma
conditions maybe drill specific
conditions? - Sure, mean, first comment right aren't tests
things. think tests metabolites, mean, things different. time,
talking metabolized, often significant extent.
Left brain, now peripheral blood really don't learn that, right?
think tend utilize medicines country healthcare
system often based throughput want polish hood
problem engine, right? overutilize medicines often end point,
right? Oh, going make person's depression better antidepressant.
Well, mean maybe, right? time person's depression really get
better stay better, need unravel driving depression, right'
first step think cut two steps it, right? first assessment step is,
diagnosis that, vast majority time, not sometimes, time, really
warrants medicine? bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right? diagnoses
we, understand going brain
medicines can treat stabilize them, doesn't mean medicine necessarily,
not substitute therapy, right? sometimes medicine therapy can go
hand hand. OCD, example, warrants therapy, almost, not always,
almost always warrants medicine too, can ease systems making
rigidity repetition brain. first kind branch point can be,
diagnosis? level severity, right? think very, important
think little more, maybe even interesting using medicines help
person engage therapy productively possible. think
limited categorize medicines sort pharmaceutical insurance
driven medical system think throws us off tremendous ways.
think medicines categorized, antidepressants. vast majority


people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

people helped antidepressants, not, don't clinically severe
depression, right? medicines create distress tolerance us, right?
think helpful can be, going go, now going
something difficult, right? going bring trauma stressors
surface going process going try make life change.
can make distress tolerance us, can so, much better, right? think
category medicines called antipsychotics, really puts people
off, right? prescriptions antipsychotics not psychosis, right?
ways low dosing medicines can help intervene
negative pathways, right? pathways distress. sending
tendrils neurons hyper vigilance avoidance, right? brain.
can often get that. can improve someone's distress tolerance
can use medicines take away clinically rumination, right? Not
standard meaning word, clinical meaning it, distress
centers brain overactive. get stuck maladaptive
negative pathways think something again,
no real chance solving not going inside us.
medicines can help that, flexibility around conception
modern medical system like 15 minute visits, psychiatrist weeks
apart. mean, don't understand goes well, right? vast majority times,
think doesn't go well not enough time therapy, even generate
understanding. medicines get thrown person. how, use,
think approximately five times much medicine, think across board say
Dutch population, right? think, well, five times more, lot
medicine, right? know, healthcare system cultural system
best understanding rooted taking responsibility oneself,
right? person comes cholesterol high, right? first order business
is, hey, take better care yourself, right? Like person really needs lose
weight exercise more, right' not just jumping like, let give
medicine know, shift healthcare system
side door, right? thing true mental health, not trying
critical psychiatrists nurse practitioners people practicing
way, oftentimes no choice, right? working healthcare
system that, standard highly spaced spaced apart, 15 minute visits,


alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

alternative there, right. look at, okay, going use medicines don't
another tool bring bear. think healthcare system focus
throughput short term talk about, talk short term response, right? Short
term soothing expense long-term health. think metaphor for,
applies healthcare system, right? we, going try treat
symptom short term, going 15 minute visit, going
way maybe soothes symptom, maybe doesn't, not get
problem. need invest resources get problem think
sort protest, people, society, say, look, don't like way
healthcare going. Like, need focus actual problems yes,
spend money, treating people taking care people 'cause
human time, ultimately less suffering, less death, right? ultimately
productivity. think economy, save much money spend
money human aspects mental healthcare, people
functional. spending less time hospital, right? productive
working. less entry criminal justice system. think
medicines get overused part systemic reasons, large part, systemic reasons.
also categorization reasons, oh, person meets
technical criteria depression. got give medicine instead really
thinking, wait, going person. see again. see
one seven medicines seven medicines treat seven different
symptoms. now side effects seven medicines. Maybe two
treat side effects five, right? bad, right?
really get going them, now much better maybe
two medicines, right? dunno helpful answer that. - is,
helpful answer. mean, think least spheres run days, hear
lot negative statements antidepressants. think, old enough remember
book, "Listening Prozac." remember Prozac things like first
started showing excitement. nowadays hear
problems drugs maybe just, 'cause arms the,
scientific, also kind wellness community people think lot
behavioral change. Fortunately think that.

01:28:35 Short-term vs. Long-Term Use Prescription Drugs, Antidepressants



course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

course drugs, mentioned, can enormous utility well. - [Paul]
Yes. - like just pick one theme haven't heard lot anywhere else,
short term versus long term use drugs. 'Cause imagine,
someone feeling like finally going tackle something inside
long time either really struggling just done not
working decide start medication give higher
levels distress tolerance short while. mean, anything say
someone couldn't take properly prescribed medication week first three
months work? - Yes. - know can come off think
black white model of, okay, either going start drug stay
forever taking drugs forever. - [Paul] Right. - not going take
anything. mean, just seems to, life doesn't have, life work way? -
[Paul] Right. short term use can effective? - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
American medicine much better starting medicines taking
away, right? part think driven strong presence
pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry lot good things,
right? know, thing much good thing, right?
society, something seems positive, think also human nature. can
overinvest it, right? think Prozac kinds medicines
came out, safer medicines, billed antidepressants thought
was, well, going fix depression, right? not works, right?
look tools, right, can deploy sometimes longer term
'cause sometimes necessary. absolutely shorter term, absolutely.
thought Prozac kind medicines, not as, oh antidepressants,
think, look, they, seem make serotonin certain
circuits important mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
medicines can really help somebody severely depressed
want sort get feeling better. can also help someone use
distress tolerance discrete period time, right? think
way, think tools apply short term long term.
don't see fixes, right? don't see substitutes
human human work needs done. mean, sort training
times healthcare systems seen many circumstances look


medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools

medicines answers idea that, person a, lot times there'll
number, right, right? number diagnosis number gets
medicine. not sure misguided leads
adding medicines, adding medicines, not working. course not working,
no one's really paying attention going on. add medicines
medicines medicines. mean, know true. know
true, haven't wherewithal society say like lot things
society, say like isn't okay, right? mean, need more. Like give people
trying help us. need latitude help us. need human
human contact get really going on, yes, investment time
energy money short term sometimes money systems,
right?

01:32:18 Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Prescription Drugs

that, goodness, look the, look payoff that. -
thought anxiety ADHD separate phenomena, terms medication.
Again, ADHD thing seems come questions. can't tell
number especially students, also young working professionals even people
outside categories interested taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
Armodafinil Vyvanse, seem struggle focusing without it. Or,
don't know, 'cause not one individuals, seem just like
well can focus take compounds. understanding
compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission brain, also
adrenaline, epinephrine brain. less stimulants. look lot
like, least chemically, look lot like cocaine amphetamine, although
not quite cocaine amphetamine. concerned this?
different sort epidemic? Can drugs used train brain focus
people can withdraw drugs? mean, think huge topic one
maybe warrants episode entirely, long topic,
thoughts medication ADHD? - Sure, think medication ADHD can
extremely effective studies show us that, right? show us
ADD, medication ADD, very, helpful true youths, seems
true adults adult ADHD ADD, kind know true, attention


deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

deficit not Attention Deficit Disorder, right? go reflexive 15 minute
visits, throw medicines things, right? Attention deficit can come many, many
places. one anxiety, right? many reasons depression
affects attention, poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention, stress life
can affect attention. So, and, certainly trauma. thing, problems
trauma spins off can affect attention. really the, really truth
teaching medicines pharmacology, frustrated
answer everything like, medicine use? medicine use,
opposed like, just one piece puzzle. told anecdote, which, think
clinical anecdote, like think going on? think told
to, dunno, middle school students something, probably say, just told
story person rock shoe, I, story actually
telling, right? several people talking to, physicians, right? ADD, right?
like, no, every time person steps rock hurts not able
maintain attention, right? Like going on. programmed think
medicines inappropriate use ADD medicines, said,
dopaminergic impact. epinephrine, norepinephrine impact. affecting
called prefrontal alpha 2 receptors like really need helped real
ADD isn't, not good thing do, quite fascinating
people ADD, tolerate generally stimulants well, without
problems can come stimulants. again, don't know, don't claim
know is, see phenomenon. people treated
ADD don't ADD, sometimes know don't ADD,
stimulants make function better. go somebody get
stimulants. not good thing do, right? 'Cause stimulants, not
needed time, affect physical function. affect judgment, right?
lot negative things come that. can affect vigilance
inside us. So, yes, valid diagnosis, gets made not present
often, see lot diagnoses can throw medicine at. see
thing bipolar disorder. True bipolar disorder extremely important utilize
medicines effectively, many people diagnosed bipolar disorder
have, absolutely don't bipolar disorder, can catchall diagnosis
sense, "something it," right? can throw medicine
it, right? mean, expect, right? healthcare system


get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

get 15 minute visits psychiatrist, course going throw medicines
everything. training paradigms going look lens.
often again, give example seeing somebody seven medicines.
mean first thought many medicines actually
counterproductive? lot time not like, oh, every now one
counterproductive. No, case. case lot time. again,
come back to,

01:37:31 Negative Effects ADHD Prescription Drugs

not putting thought it, result expect? - Thank
answer. curious constitutes negative effects stimulants.
somebody's taking Adderall Ritalin order work longer hours focus
attention deficit, not necessarily ADHD. again, not recommending
anyone this. just heard numbers come back least surveys
discussions colleagues Stanford elsewhere, college campuses
upwards 75% college students use semi regularly, drugs off, not
prescription, just study learn. - [Paul] Yes. - can imagine sleep issues
people, stimulants, sorts issues can
create people problems can create? - Sure, mean, think touchstone
maybe running conversation, right, prioritizing short term benefit
solving long-term problem, right? might say human tendency
see across topics discussing. So, short-term use stimulants. Sure,
people alert. can stay awake more, can study intensely
longer. Okay, short-term benefit that, there, even there, can
problems, right? can say, just say sake argument short
term, something gained that, right? oh goodness,
much is, much risk that, right? many times seen
someone just study, right? now
addicted amphetamines behavior changes don't know it.
Talk shifting brain towards defensive, sort suspicious, outward look,
view world see lot that. see judgment impairment, see
heightened levels anxiety. see impulsivity decision-making.
sometimes we, can get point seeing Frank psychosis. Now, not


common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

common, seen young people who've done exactly describing,
right? using Adderall using Ritalin study. see
coming hospital, screaming someone's trying hurt
them. Boy, worst case scenario, shows like can go.
much the, oh, just using study severe, outcome
actually quite negative person might change think
friendship relationship, right? lot negative happens change brains
without ability see like, actually us? So, part whole
theme trauma, right? changes brains don't know it, right? Well
can be, often true amphetamines used inappropriately. shifts
brain. don't realize little bit impulsive decision making,
little bit less trusting. significant negative things don't know it,
person will just say, yeah, oh, just using study. using work more.

01:40:37 Alcohol, Cannabis – Positive & Negative Effects

not, know, not without high level risk. - thoughts
cannabis? said many times podcast say again, feel
fortunate never really attracted alcohol drugs kind , much
alcohol marijuana cocaine amphetamine
disappeared, wouldn't notice change life, right? feel lucky way,
'cause know lot people feel attraction things almost
gravitational force. - [Paul] Yes. - first drink, just feel, heard
described this, think Augusten Burroughs book, "Dry"
alcoholic. said first drink had, felt like magic elixir meshed
physiology blood seamless way reading this,
thought, oh goodness, first all, foreign experience terms
alcohol. second gosh, must terrible. can, time
really understand someone drawn that. - Yes. cannabis
nowadays legal decriminalized many areas U.S. lot people seem
use argument, better drinking sleep anxiety
management. not looking demonize support cannabis.
thoughts cannabis anxiety management, depression? maybe even
ADHD matter. Sure. - make alcohol comment, right? number


times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools
there. behalf listeners myself, thank much joining us today. -

times seen alcohol like good idea coping something
approaches zero, right? Like alcohol coping just never good.
additional risk factor certain genetic profiles people respond strongly
alcohol. Like, saying, not just, oh, little bit short term relief
distress, sort euphoric response genetics, don't
understand completely. seem Northern European populations,
prevalent head west Northern Europe. understand risk factors
demographically, can't pinpoint one person.
tremendous risk that, person responds strongly alcohol habituates
coping alcohol. Cannabis little bit different story. mean, seen
play out, again, isn't coming expertise around neuro
neuropharmacology it, like really working brain? comes
observation seems narrow attentional perspective, right?
people will say, well, want to, want use cannabis like
watching movie friends something, right? And, think, okay, think
people cognitive spectrum narrows. instead
worrying thing work relationship issue, one can just present,
right? gates attentional intrusions, right? ways, mean,
absolutely seen helpful people. mean, legalized Oregon,
my, spent lot time not practice is,
seen times helpful, safe around sleep, right? person can gate
intrusive thoughts can just relax go sleep. can
another side too, higher levels distress, higher levels tension,
can narrow focus cognition thing negative, right? idea
that, oh, like, oh, treatment for, depression, anxiety, trauma, not true, right?
Can helpful certain circumstances? Like think answer is, yeah.
mean, know answer yes. 'Cause seen play clinically way,
think can also harmful too. there, again, like anything power,
power influence brains, want thoughtful careful it. mean,
think safer alcohol? Yes, mean, mean, like we, clearly see that.
mean? just uniformly safe? No, right. want respectful
anything can change brain working think includes,

01:44:53 Psychedelics: Psylocibin & LSD, Therapeutic Uses, Trauma Recovery



certainly includes alcohol. think certainly includes cannabis too. - love talk
psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems

psychedelics two reasons. One, seems tremendous amount
interest psychedelics therapeutic clinical tool. know also recreational use
just preface saying stance absolutely know sure
controlled substances, illegal possess, sell use
country. areas it, decriminalized. - [Paul] Yes.
psychedelics broad category, course. can touch different,
different ones, whereas five years so, five years ago truly afraid say
word psychedelics kind public venue, laboratories Stanford
working ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly animal models. terrific work
going Johns Hopkins University School Medicine, Matthew Johnson's Lab,
others looking clinical applications, mainly high dose psilocybin LSD.
maps trials MDMA. - [Paul] Yes. - nowadays safe
academic like say word psychedelics. I'm, love approach
question psychedelics place true exploration curiosity.
preface talking legal clinical setting. - [Paul] Yes. -
legality something now process. don't think completed,
understanding, trials. can go clinical trials.gov put MDMA,
see bunch clinical trials happening recruiting subjects.
think safe conversation now, love thoughts
psychedelics. Maybe start psilocybin LSD broad category
drugs, least understanding touch mainly serotonin system,
specific receptor activation modulation, tend change notions space
time, adjust internal state. Maybe start there. - [Paul] Yes. - maybe
venture ones. thoughts drugs
therapeutic potential also potential hazards, etcetera. - Yeah, think look true
psychedelics, psilocybin LSD, right? ketamine MDMA,
different categories medicine. sort novel tools bring bear.
start psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, think is, gained
much momentum last several years data coming
labs academic centers powerfully positive. someone who's,
interested anything potentially helpful, right? want learn understand
lot things potentially helpful, know, go look


data see not helpful, harmful. think seen
psychedelics helpful, right? trials bearing out.
course used professional hands right kind guidance
extremely powerful tools, used right way someone knows utilize
right setting can immense positive impact. think
thought across people people feel comfortable saying
talking it, mean state Oregon now thought is,
moving towards legalization psilocybin early 2023. part new data, right?
meshes older data, right? meshes data 60s
70s showed strong, powerful impact medicines. whole
set thoughts happening just conjectures, right?
read of, know, best can try understand neuroscience
clinical applicability changes is, happens see less communication
less chatter outer parts brain, right? outer parts cortex.
think human beings, sort glorify parts brain have.
mean, certainly growing up, right? mean, learn? Even think
like, learning brain high school, right? learned like, wow,
great humans 'cause language animals don't can use
tools like aren't great part brain
animals don't lets us function, right? Okay, truth that. can
things others can't do. get lost often outer parts cortex,
think survival, right? come back things talked
early like, trauma mechanisms us, right? like much
going brains survival. think living speak
cortex, right? outer part brain consistent focus survival.
think language is, vision is, executive function
is. planning task execution, much making way world
around us. tend glorify think, well, sense
existence is, right? believe not true, right? again, can say sure,
course not, right? read 20 years clinical work thinking
sorts medicines thinking psychedelics lot depth, think
take us cortex, right? run
problems. bounce things distress centers
deepen brain brain stem kind align outer parts cortex


say, right, distress. want stay alive. Often lot us
trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets
sick? thinking future projection coming place fear, right?
coming desire think things control future part
brain uniquely human, right? think take neuro
transmission places, right? set part brain say
insular cortex, right? parts brain sort middle, right?
think, believe humanness really is. psychedelics make
less chatter communication parts brain. become
seated part brain believe experience true
humanness, why, read about, people experiences
heard people talk this, right? utilized it. talk
me. whether someone telling story coming research data,
people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release
guilt say, helpful people? think
can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care

glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,
incredible, will go record saying, think definitive book trauma.
- Wow, thank you. - really encourage people read will continue
encourage people read it. many valuable takeaways insights tools

trauma makes changes brain thinking time, like
if, war, civil war, someone
bombs us, will economy collapses, right? will somebody gets

people can sort see clarity that, oh, trauma, thing not fault,
right? Like feel sense compassion ourselves. relieve ourselves, release

can trying get good therapy, can really catalyze
just putting person part brain can see is, without
chatter cortex about, hey, got think father, won't avoid
makes repetition compulsion. think ahead next thing
might happen else bad might happen? mean, don't get anywhere
that. think get somewhere seed deeper
brain, think if, like really good therapy we're,
deep parts brain, these, psychedelics, medicinal value believe
putting us part brain person can really find truth.
think that, come far years think clinically
evident. think going see value how,
psychedelics can become, believe heuristic understanding like wait,
brains really functioning? parts really matter
experience human? parts brain, right? deep parts
brain, insular cortex areas around say light person
experience spiritual ecstasy experience connection another person,


right? kind telltale markers something going

think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today
done wide deep search people areas.
background medical training physiology, psychoanalytic
psychiatric realm also grounding toward future, coming
can encapsulate many different orientations bring together
coherent piece. really thank you. - appreciate that. - Yeah, book,

right? kind telltale markers something going
important special. think attracted outer parts
brain part 'cause easier study, right? mean, know, better do,
started studying brain lesion studies, right? 'Cause easy to,
see person got hurt part brain stroke part brain,
changes? look cortex 'cause one, easier study tend
glorify it. think misguided. think learning.
misguided study novel modalities Western
perspectives, course used long, long time cultures,

01:54:32 Sentience, Language, Animals

novel perspective. - Yeah, fascinated idea middle
brain structures is, humanity lies said, also wonder whether
not animals experience life orientation less chatter. can
guess, but. - [Paul] right. know, dog lover presence
animals seem just present happening immediate
environment, not much anticipation. - Right, mean, sentient right? mean
talking sentience, important. sentience extremely
important, right? going overvalue say language, think
undervalue sentience, right? think tend undervalue animals, right?
suffering, say, well, not saying anything it, right?
know, not writing it, so, okay. easy ignore think about,
hubris right though, can think talk write, like must
feeling species don't that. mean think, think true
going understand sentience species how,
core existence. hope value

01:55:48 Psychedelic Hallucinations, Trauma Recovery

humans animals, right? evolution understanding. -
hallucinations accompany psychedelics like LSD psilocybin
attractive force concept experience. think often
people hear hallucinogens, think, psychedelics, think


hallucinating. - [Paul] Right. - makes sense would. - [Paul] Right. -
interesting nothing answer psychedelics, psilocybin LSD
focused hallucinations, per se. feeling states, accessing feeling
state relation event person oneself. Maybe even I, caught hints
maybe even empathy one's self. - Yes. - [Andrew] first time. - Yes. - None
seeing sounds hearing colors kind cliche
statements hallucination. aware laboratories, one University
California Davis particular, others trying generate chemical
variance psychedelics lack hallucinogenic properties, maintain
properties therapeutic tools. say that, realize I, people
psychedelic community probably thinking, oh, horrible. dismantling
core thing. simple question is, think hallucinations valuable
anything? - think really getting philosophical, right,
ontological, right? sort trying understand being, right? don't claim
know answer that. think times seems like hallucinations
metaphorical symbolic way helpful, right? people will come
understand things hold dear true experience, right? often,
not always, come lens hallucinations. hallucinations
necessary? hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not? mean,
think don't understand that. think want respectful sort mystery
that. think fascinating think like substance abuse
means is, well, one aspect person experiences, thoughts,
conceptions self world substance without substance, know
wrong, right? People talk about, know, liquid courage, right? okay, feel
better feel courageous 'cause couple drinks. Now,
I, I, that, feel like normal false, right? see
like, part substance intoxication means, right? see
psychedelic medicines something incredibly different, right? people
experiences delinked normal experience reality.
come sense back online right, normal cognitive way, realize
like, wow, now applying mechanisms trying understand truth
that, see true wow, true. Like, mean, hear
time, tells me, hey, something different going there. course
powerful tools misused like bad things can happen. think


clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -

care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
language? don't want use language controlled someone thinks
sort understand better rest us communicate us. Okay,
don't want that. stereotypically sort idea left say, right? least


society, also don't want, language, can angry aggressive
perpetuating spreading vulnerability facilitates trauma. think
set standards society say, look, don't want anybody power
going behave way, right? don't care whole agenda like, make Paul
Conti's life better. still not going vote you, right? behaving towards
others way denigrating, behaving way feel essentially
ashamed of, right? feel lot, right? see politics, know, see things
play out. not always political, course not always political, see things play
think, oh gosh, feel embarrassed. Like somehow okay this.
Well, doesn't matter side political spectrum coming to. think
indicator really hurtful us. People become
angry. attach anger. People feel beleaguered. divisions
us. seems like, well, can really identify
people just like us like, really mean? mean, divisions
creates us promotes many negative things, right? mean,
think ways promotes white supremacy, right? just one example,
right? seen play really bad us. got look
that. mean, don't look that, don't think something going happen. Like
something happening, right? happening now. - Yeah, I'm, really, mind,
really seeps soil everything talking about. - Yes. -
sides. - [Paul] Yes. - People activated. People upset one thing
other. - Right. - No one immune upset regardless political affiliation. - [Paul]
Right. - Everybody seems upset nowadays. - [Paul] Right. - hearing
talk this, feel lot resonance said also hoping run
office. - Thank you. don't think gumption thank for.

02:15:09 Defining “Taking Care Oneself”

- [Andrew] Well, wonderful. - Thank you. like talk concept
taking care one's self. comes book. - [Paul] Yes. - something
talk lot podcast. mean, think people heard blab endlessly,
probably go grave telling people get sunlight eyes
can try get proper sleep tools reducing anxiety
real time on. - [Paul] Right. - hear concept taking


care oneself think surface level, can sound little bit light, know, oh,
take care, take care, take good care. deep powerful concept. - [Paul]
Yes. - happy see book also learn lot ideas
really looks like, whether not somebody early stages
considering whether not trauma deep stages working
made tunnel distance taking care oneself
ongoing process. - [Paul] Yes. - love just describe taking care
oneself means clinician. course practices things
encourage people do. think taking care oneself
one extreme, imagine massages treats vacations chefs hire
take care everything ourselves. extreme, say, leaning
life way paying attention small things working very,
hard. big concept, think taking care one's self?
take care myself? - [Paul] Sure. - people take care
themselves? - Sure. - see here, think fascinating dichotomy, right?
ways, like, think complex brains are, right? complex
psyches, unconscious minds are. much complexity there,
hand, psychological concepts consistent health often simple, right?
don't mean light, right? simple, straightforward, right? think self-care
absolutely one them. mean, much talked about, take care one self
just skips basics necessary building block else.
doesn't matter many chefs vacations whatever person basics
self-care aren't squared away. not light concept say like, sleeping
enough, right? eating well? getting natural light? interacting
people good interact with, right? accepting negative interactions
life? living circumstances make feel okay not?
basic premises, often not looking all, right? not looking
tend skip tend skip either,
because, again, automatic way sometimes trauma driven not
going look that, right? often not taking care can
punishment distraction, right? much can come that. sense
power is, tied not taking care ourselves. mean, give example tend
to, whatever reason reasonably well poor self care, right? like,
adaptive medical training, right? like, okay, can eat


lot today. can not eat, right? can sleep two hours. can sleep eight, right? mean,
overall, not good. hasn't good aged. realized
look, things make healthier, like what, ignored
that, right? ignoring it? key question. ignoring it?
somewhere inside me, was, still extent is, idea
ability really functional, right? generate success world around tied
ability that, right? That, oh, stop now like, eating
sleeping regularly, going lose edge. even think
time, realize, hey, also, not inside, know? think
really grounding basics really help us like, basics
not life, diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure
activities. mean, sunlight. think immensely important dramatically undervalued. -
Well, want thank that. want thank today's discussion. found
incredibly informative know listeners will also. also want thank
work do. mean, obviously run incredibly robust clinical practice
aware constantly trying improve, even though operating
highest levels already. - appreciate that. - really, reason today

clinical utility mean many people change healthier
even change lives experience resonates like, oh, now
understand something true. not something bizarre. like, wasn't
responsible raped time not less even though sexuality
gender identity's different silly binary concept, right? Like people kind often
get feel differently guilt shame impacted.
think likely see powerful anti-trauma mechanisms again, used
clinically right hands. think also going see heuristic
understanding brain goes see reflexive hubris
of, well, outer parts must best makes us human
animals don't it.

02:00:01 MDMA (Therapeutic Uses)

better human. mean, makes no sense, know? - like
talk MDMA preface saying participant actually, technically
still participant clinical trial. experience twice trial
involves three separate dosings this. reluctant outside clinical trial,
mostly aware can cardiac effects. liked idea
clinician hand. just say found experiences
profound, beneficial different one session next. first one felt
whole collection ideas relational things came felt powerful
transformative. think learned there, exported number things,
particular experience isn't relevant here, second time expected
way. mellow relaxing deeply tied kind notions
acceptance. weren't revelations wow new insights.
much sort grounding kind calmer state. personal
experience benefiting ways think still benefit
struck power MDMA. crude understanding pharmacology
state MDMA encourages increases dopaminergic
transmission, also serotonergic transmission. - Yeah. - knowledge,
kind rare state brain typically seesaw dopaminergic
drive towards external goals serotonergic drive towards plasticity
comfort one already has. systems amplified,


way can describe subjectively it, everything sort funneled back in,
almost like pursuit inner landscape. can imagine like
context somebody else also taking MDMA. no idea
like. report experience. know experience can vary.
thoughts chemistry sorts states think MDMA
creating can explain useful therapeutic tool cases sorts
cases might be. - Sure, sure. clarify, think part starting
different psychedelics, right? seeding consciousness
deep centers brain, right? Whereas MDMA sort
flooding positive neurotransmitters, right? certain parts brain. think
creates greater permissiveness inside entertain approach different
things, right? think see tremend, read data around
potentially seeing trials, right? Tremendous benefit trauma,
right? think talking earlier, reflexive, guilt,
shame, hypervigilance, avoidance, right? systems flooded
neurotransmitters, permissive sort think that, right?
think without again, chatter fault, never going
get anywhere that, know means, right? kind
go away can think way isn't lens fear, right?
think that's, power permissive approaching something,
contemplating something, different, novelty talk de novo approach.
think also experience can vary also see how,
not thinking something, right? not clinical guidance it,
state like, hey, just feel good, right? thinking good
things. like, can feel good, right? it, not necessarily problem
solving, right? clinical guidance says, hey, take state something
it, right? Now state, make hay sun shinning,
right? state can look things traumatic, right? can
approach de novo perspective. think part, think explains
different experiences one other, brain just
state conducive something, right? not mechanism
thing happen, like conducive something therapeutic, might go
own. might just state



02:04:47 Clinical Aspects MDMA

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential

sense wellbeing sit that. - sort seems like
waste me. mean, tell people ask MDMA. said,
least experience potential hazard high
dopaminergic, serotonergic state, moments felt like get
excited one specific concept might even just think about, instance,
water nourishing is, really just go path water world
water can, state prone suggestion. - [Paul]
Yes. - Internal suggestion. guidance turned out, guidance
clinician turned immensely valuable allowing go heads
bits time, also resurface share exchange way to, trying
really get something useful export course
water wonderful, not really interested growing relationship water. -
[Paul] Yes. really felt like in, understand the, never went raves
anything growing up. never MDMA recreationally, understood first time
people get really attached environment feel connected things.
think serotonin, just feel connected everything around you.
think slippery slope there. - Yes. - don't know future
clinical use MDMA looks like, hope whoever's thinking
guiding sessions really thinking carefully, also evolving practice
help people really move sequential way can leave something
valuable. - Yes, 100%, 100%. powerful tools. again,
powerful tools using without respect them, right? Without clinical
guidance, incur risk, right? mean, know, getting obsessed water
probably isn't going hurt you, right? someone using it, around
people, one can feel positively become sort obsessed short term
can counterproductive, right? can lot risk that. think
anchors back powerful tools. coming understand much,
much more. coming understand immense potential
helpful us. think hope also increases respect
modalities can come, negative can happen not respectful. -
going interesting see goes next years, not just
Oregon, elsewhere. One way another happening. seems


momentum not going stop.

02:07:28 Language, Processing Trauma, Social Media, Societal Divisions

exciting area sure. - agree. - question language.
book, talk need careful use language around
trauma. - [Paul] Yes. - Maybe problem solving problem describing general. one
extreme, hear brain body hear every word say, and,
know, careful language. actually frightened
number years, 'cause hear thought, gosh, just think
something bad now going hurt worse, part whole,
packing issue. hard avoid thoughts without distraction. - [Paul] Yes. -
one extreme, hand, can say, can tell somebody, love
tone hatred. can tell somebody hate tone love. - [Paul] Yes. -
think language parsing trauma? book talk
about, give cautionary notes talking depression, trauma
PTSD terms might diminish real severity cases. really
struck that. maybe just touch talk things way
doesn't diminish people. time
honors fact lot trauma there. - [Paul] Right - lot
depression need talk it. - Yeah. think complicated
many ways convoluted topic, like think wonderful language,
boy, language leads us astray often too. think we, people define
words? Someone says word, it? person know word
means? nuance taking from? just careful
saying communicating. think doesn't mean because,
sort phenomenon now people trying control language think much,
like can't say anything someone else might find hurtful refer
people ways choose referred to, even ways others don't
understand, ways decided ways might
psychologically clinically unhelpful. think control language not good,
think specificity language trying say, defining
it? even word trauma, right? talking trauma. want define
means, right? doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind negative, right?


dilutes meaning nothing, right? also doesn't just mean,
injury combat, right? Like talk is. think anchoring
something rises magnitude overwhelming coping skills changing
us, like least define way can communicate can
understand talking about, right? think another aspect language,
again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness
think comes anger frustration people, back trauma, right? people
just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic

not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater

again, need middle ground don't think okay control
language shut expression, also acknowledge,
much less distanced social media. think social media can
very, good things hopefully now, right? can also used
harm people distance, right? much hatefulness

just want angry not really issues talking about,
target anger people feel beleaguered that. words people
use sometimes awful someone reading that, like demographic
targeted, right? reading that, mean, person not feel,
not feel, set upon vulnerable, right? think also fuels, things like just
terrible shooting Buffalo, right? Like just hate motivated, right? think
that, kind language becomes real people may take in,
fuels hate something enact it, course creates greater
feel fear vulnerability. think civility decorum
world, not long ago, right? mean, know, early fifties, not
old, right? remember time political discourse, say people civil
one another, right? Now much, mean, not it, right?
acceptance things just bombastic, right? circus side show sometimes
people just angry aggressive not really linked anything, although
allegedly linked something, people's anger can attach it. not
about, aligning anger think
much damage comes that. think, have, okay
people sometimes talking, communicating, using language ways like
get us suspended middle school, right? Ways don't want eight year old see,
mean, really okay? need take stand like rational use
